<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>


<p>A considerable portion of the present work, comprising
the whole of the first volume and the first two chapters of the
second, is reprinted with corrections and additions from the
<cite>Westminster Review</cite>. The last chapter of the second volume
has already appeared under a slightly different title in <cite>Mind</cite>
for January and April 1882. The chapters entitled, ‘The
Sceptics and Eclectics,’ ‘The Religious Revival,’ and ‘The
Spiritualism of Plotinus,’ are now published for the first
time.</p>

<p>The subject of Greek philosophy is so vast that, in
England at least, it has become customary to deal with it in
detached portions rather than as a connected whole. This
method has its advantages, but it has also its drawbacks.
The critic who singles out some one thinker for special study
is apt to exaggerate the importance of his hero and to credit
him with the origination of principles which were really
borrowed from his predecessors. Moreover, the appearance
of a new idea can only be made intelligible by tracing the
previous tendencies which it either continues, combines, or
contradicts. In a word, the history of philosophy has itself a
philosophy which requires that we should go beyond particular
phenomena and view them as variously related parts
of a single system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span></p>

<p>The history of Greek philosophy, whether conceived in
this comprehensive sense or as an erudite investigation into
matters of detail, is a province which the Germans have made
peculiarly their own; and, among German scholars, Dr.
Zeller is the one who has treated it with most success. My
obligations to his great work are sufficiently shown by the
copious references to it which occur throughout the following
pages. It is in those instances&mdash;and they are, unfortunately,
very numerous&mdash;where our knowledge of particular philosophers
and of their opinions rests on fragmentary or second-hand
information, that I have found his assistance most valuable.
This has especially been the case with reference to the
pre-Socratic schools, the minor successors of Socrates, the
earlier Stoics, the Sceptics, and the later Pythagoreans. I
must, however, guard against the supposition that my work is,
in any respect, a popularisation or abridgment of Zeller’s.
To popularise Zeller would, indeed, be an impertinence, for
nothing can be more luminous and interesting than his style
and general mode of exposition. Nor am I playing the part
of a finder to a large telescope; for my point of view by no
means coincides with that of the learned German historian.
Thus, while my limits have obliged me to be content with a
very summary treatment of many topics which he has discussed
at length, there are others, and those, in my opinion,
not the least important, to which he has given less space than
will be found allotted to them here. On several questions,
also, I have ventured to controvert his opinions, notably with
reference to the Sophists, Socrates, Aristotle, and Plotinus.
My general way of looking at the Greeks and their philosophy
also differs from his. And the reasons which have led me to
follow an independent course in this respect involve consider<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">ix</span>ations
of such interest and importance, that I shall take the
liberty of specifying them in some detail.</p>

<p>Stated briefly, Zeller’s theory of ancient thought is that
the Greeks originally lived in harmony with Nature; that
the bond was broken by philosophy and particularly by the
philosophy of Socrates; that the discord imperfectly overcome
by Plato and Aristotle revealed itself once more in the unreconciled,
self-concentrated subjectivity of the later schools;
that this hopeless estrangement, after reaching its climax in
the mysticism of the Neo-Platonists, led to the complete
collapse of independent speculation; and that the creation of
a new consciousness by the advent of Christianity and of the
Germanic races was necessary in order to the successful resumption
of scientific enquiry. Zeller was formerly a Hegelian,
and it seems to me that he still retains far too much of
the Hegelian formalism in his historical constructions. The
well-worked antithesis between object and subject, even after
being revised in a positivist sense, is totally inadequate to the
burden laid on it by this theory; and if we want really to
understand the causes which first hampered, then arrested, and
finally paralysed Greek philosophy, we must seek for them in
a more concrete order of considerations. Zeller, with perfect
justice, attributes the failure of Plato and Aristotle to their
defective observation of Nature and their habit of regarding
the logical combinations of ideas derived from the common
use of words as an adequate representative of the relations
obtaining among things in themselves. But it seems an
extremely strained and artificial explanation to say that their
shortcomings in this respect were due to a confusion of the
objective and the subjective, consequent on the imperfect
separation of the Greek mind from Nature&mdash;a confusion, it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span>
added, which only the advent of a new religion and a new
race could overcome.<a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> It is unfair to make Hellenism as a
whole responsible for fallacies which might easily be paralleled
in the works of modern metaphysicians; and the unfairness
will become still more evident when we remember that, after
enjoying the benefit of Christianity and Germanism for a
thousand years, the modern world had still to take its first
lessons in patience of observation, in accuracy of reasoning,
and in sobriety of expression from such men as Thucydides
and Hippocrates, Polybius, Archimêdes and Hipparchus.
Even had the Greeks as a nation been less keen to distinguish
between illusion and reality than their successors up to the
sixteenth century&mdash;a supposition notoriously the reverse of
true&mdash;it would still have to be explained why Plato and
Aristotle, with their prodigious intellects, went much further
astray than their predecessors in the study of Nature. And
this Zeller’s method does not explain at all.</p>

<p>Again, I think that Zeller quite misconceives the relation
between Greek philosophy and Greek life when he attributes
the intellectual decline of the post-Aristotelian period, in part
at least, to the simultaneous ruin of public spirit and political
independence. The degeneracy of poetry and art, of eloquence
and history, may perhaps be accounted for in this
way, but not the relaxation of philosophical activity. On the
contrary, the disappearance of political interests was of all
conditions the most favourable to speculation, as witness the
Ionians, Democritus, and Aristotle. Had the independence
and power of the great city-republics been prolonged much
further, it is probable&mdash;as the example of the Sophists and
Socrates seems to show&mdash;that philosophy would have become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">xi</span>
still more absorbingly moral and practical than it actually
became in the Stoic, Epicurean, and Sceptical schools. And
theoretical studies did, in fact, receive a great impulse from
the Macedonian conquest, a large fund of intellectual energy
being diverted from public affairs to the pursuit of knowledge,
only it took the direction of positive science rather
than of general speculation.<a id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>The cause which first arrested and finally destroyed the
free movement of Greek thought was not any intrinsic limitation
or corruption of the Greek genius, but the ever-increasing
preponderance of two interests, both tending, although in
different ways and different degrees, to strengthen the principle
of authority and to enfeeble the principle of reason.
One was the theological interest, the other was the scholastic
interest. The former was the more conspicuous and the
more mischievous of the two. From the persecution of
Anaxagoras to the prohibition of philosophical teaching by
Justinian, we may trace the rise and spread of a reaction towards
superstition, sometimes advancing and sometimes receding,
but, on the whole, gaining ground from age to age,
until from the noontide splendour of Pericles we pass to
that long night which stretches in almost impenetrable darkness
down to the red and stormy daybreak of the Crusades.
And it was a reaction which extended through all classes,
including the philosophers themselves. It seems to me that
where the Athenian school, from Socrates on, fall short of their
predecessors, as in some points they unquestionably do, their
inferiority is largely due to this cause. Its influence is very
perceptible in weakening the speculative energies of those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">xii</span>
who stand at the greatest distance from the popular beliefs.
It was because dislike for theology occupied so large a place
in the thoughts of Epicurus and his disciples, that they valued
science only as a refutation of its teaching, instead of regarding
it simply as an obstacle to be removed from the path of
enquiry. More than this; they became infected with the
spirit of that against which they fought, and their absolute
indifference to truth was the shadow which it cast on their
minds.</p>

<p>The theological interest and the scholastic interest, though
not necessarily associated, have, as already observed, a point
of contact in their common exaltation of authority. Thus,
for our present purpose they may be classified under the
more general notion of traditionalism. By this term I understand
a disposition to accept as true opinions received either
by the mass of mankind or by the best accredited teachers,
and to throw these opinions into a form adapted for easy
transmission to others. In this sense, traditionalism is Janus-faced,
looking on one side to the past and on the other to
the future. Now philosophy could only gain general acceptance
by becoming a tradition. For a long time the Greek
thinkers busied themselves almost exclusively with the discovery
of truth, remaining comparatively indifferent to its
diffusion. As Plato says, they went their own way without
caring whether they took us along with them or not.<a id="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> And
it was at this period that the most valuable speculative ideas
were first originated. At last a strong desire arose among the
higher classes to profit by the results of the new learning,
and a class of men came into existence whose profession was
to gratify this desire. But the Sophists, as they were called,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span>
soon found that lessons in the art of life were more highly
appreciated and more liberally rewarded than lessons in the
constitution of Nature. Accordingly, with the facile ingenuity
of Greeks, they set to work proving, first that Nature could not
be known, and finally that there was no such thing as Nature
at all. The real philosophers were driven to secure their
position by a change of front. They became teachers themselves,
disguising their lessons, however, under the form of a
search after truth undertaken conjointly with their friends,
who, of course, were not expected to pay for the privilege of
giving their assistance, and giving it for so admirable a purpose.
In this co-operative system, the person who led the conversation
was particularly careful to show that his conclusions
followed directly from the admissions of his interlocutors,
being, so to speak, latent in their minds, and only needing a
little obstetric assistance on his part to bring them into the
light of day. And the better to rivet their attention, he chose
for the subject of discussion questions of human interest, or
else, when the conversation turned to physical phenomena, he
led the way towards a teleological or aesthetical interpretation
of their meaning.</p>

<p>Thus, where Zeller says that the Greek philosophers confounded
the objective with the subjective because they were
still imperfectly separated from Nature, we seem to have come
on a less ambitious but more intelligible explanation of the
facts, and one capable of being stated with as much generality
as his. Not only among the Greeks but everywhere, culture
is more or less antagonistic to originality, and the diffusion to
the enlargement of knowledge. Thought is like water; when
spread over a wider surface it is apt to become stagnant and
shallow. When ideas could only live on the condition of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">xiv</span>
being communicated to a large circle of listeners, they were
necessarily adapted to the taste and lowered to the comprehension
of relatively vulgar minds. And not only so, but the
habit of taking their opinions and prejudices as the starting-point
of every enquiry frequently led to the investment of
those opinions and prejudices with the formal sanction of a
philosophical demonstration. It was held that education
consisted less in the acquisition of new truth than in the elevation
to clearer consciousness of truths which had all along
been dimly perceived.</p>

<p>To the criticism and systematisation of common language
and common opinion succeeded the more laborious criticism
and systematisation of philosophical theories. Such an
enormous amount of labour was demanded for the task of
working up the materials amassed by Greek thought during
the period of its creative originality, and accommodating
them to the popular belief, that not much could be done in
the way of adding to their extent. Nor was this all. Among
the most valuable ideas of the earlier thinkers were those
which stood in most striking opposition to the evidence of the
senses. As such they were excluded from the system which
had for its object the reorganisation of philosophy on the
basis of general consent. Thus not only did thought tend to
become stationary, but it even abandoned some of the ground
which had been formerly won.</p>

<p>Not that the vitality of Hellenic reason gave way simultaneously
at every point. The same independent spirit, the
same imaginative vigour which had carried physical speculation
to such splendid conquests during the first two centuries
of its existence were manifested with equal effect when the
energies previously devoted to Nature as a whole concentrated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">xv</span>
themselves on the study of conduct and belief. It was thus
that Socrates could claim the whole field of human life for
scientific treatment, and create the method by which it has ever
since been most successfully studied. It was thus that Plato
could analyse and ideally reconstruct all practices, institutions,
and beliefs. It was thus that Aristotle, while definitely arresting
the progress of research, could still complete the method
and create the language through which the results of new
research have been established, recognised, and communicated
ever since. It was thus that the Stoics advanced from paradox
to paradox until they succeeded in co-ordinating morality
for all time by reference to the three fundamental ideas of
personal conscience, individual obligation, and universal
humanity. And not only were dialectics and ethics at first
animated by the same enterprising spirit as speculative
physics, but their very existence as recognised studies must be
ascribed to its decay, to the revolution through which philosophy,
from being purely theoretical, became social and
didactic. While in some directions thought was made
stationary and even retrogressive by the very process of its
diffusion, in other directions this diffusion was the cause of its
more complete development. Finally, ethics and logic were
reduced to a scholastic routine, and progress continued to be
made only in the positive sciences, until, here also, it was
brought to an end by the triumph of superstition and barbarism
combined.</p>

<p>If the cessation of speculative activity among the Greeks
needs to be accounted for by something more definite than
phrases about the objective and the subjective, so also does
its resumption among the nations of modern Europe. This
may be explained by two different circumstances&mdash;the disap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">xvi</span>pearance
of the obstacles which had long opposed themselves
to the free exercise of reason, and the stimulus given to
enquiry by the Copernican astronomy. After spreading over
the whole basin of the Mediterranean, Hellenic culture had
next to repair the ravages of the barbarians, and, chiefly under
the form of Christianity, to make itself accepted by the new
nationalities which had risen on the ruins of the Roman
empire. So arduous a task was sufficient to engross, during
many centuries, the entire intellectual energies of Western
Europe. At last the extreme limits of diffusion were provisionally
reached, and thought once more became available
for the discovery of new truth. Simultaneously with this
consummation, the great supernaturalist reaction, having also
reached its extreme limits, had so far subsided, that Nature
could once more be studied on scientific principles, with less
freedom, indeed, than in old Ionia, but still with tolerable
security against the vengeance of interested or fanatical
opponents. And at the very same conjuncture it was shown
by the accumulated observations of many ages that the conception
of the universe on which the accepted philosophy
rested must be replaced by one of a directly opposite description.
I must confess that in this vast revolution the relation
between the objective and the subjective, as reconstituted
by Christianity and the Germanic genius, does not seem to
me to have played a very prominent part.</p>

<p>If Zeller’s semi-Hegelian theory of history does scant
justice to the variety and complexity of causes determining
the evolution of philosophy, it also draws away attention
from the ultimate elements, the matter, in an Aristotelian
sense, of which that evolution consists. By this I mean the
development of particular ideas as distinguished from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">xvii</span>
systems into which they enter as component parts. Often
the formation of a system depends on an accidental combination
of circumstances, and therefore cannot be brought
under any particular law of progress, while the ideas out of
which it is constructed exhibit a perfectly regular advance on
the form under which they last appeared. Others, again, are
characterised by a remarkable fixity which enables them to
persist unchanged through the most varied combinations and
the most protracted intervals of time. But when each system
is regarded as, so to speak, an organic individual, the complete
and harmonious expression of some one phase of
thought, and the entire series of systems as succeeding one
another in strict logical order according to some simple law
of evolution, there will be a certain tendency to regard the
particular elements of each as determined by the character of
the whole to which they belong, rather than by their intrinsic
nature and antecedent history. And I think it is owing to
this limitation of view that Zeller has not illustrated, so fully
as could be desired, the subtler references by which the
different schools of philosophy are connected with one
another and also with the literature of their own and other
times.</p>

<p>An interesting example of the process on which I have
just touched is offered by the reappearance and further
elaboration of some most important Greek ideas in modern
philosophy. In the concluding chapter of this work I have
attempted to indicate the chief lines along which such a
transmission may be traced. The subject is one which has
hitherto been unduly neglected. No critic would be justified
in describing the speculative movement of the nineteenth
century without constant reference to the metaphysicians and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">xviii</span>
moralists of the two preceding centuries. Yet the dependence
of those thinkers on the schools of antiquity is hardly less
intimate than our dependence on Spinoza and Hume.
Nevertheless, in no work that I am acquainted with has this
circumstance been used to elucidate the course pursued by
modern thought; indeed, I may say that the persistence of
Hellenic ideas down to the most recent times has not been
fully recognised by any scholar except Prof. Teichmüller,
who has particularly devoted his attention to the history of
conceptions as distinguished from the history of systems.</p>

<p>The introduction of Teichmüller’s name affords me an
opportunity for mentioning that my attention was not directed
to his brilliant researches into various questions connected
with Greek philosophy, and more particularly with the
systems of Plato and Aristotle, until it was too late for me
to profit by them in the present work. I allude more particularly
to his <cite>Studien zur Geschichte der Begriffe</cite> (Berlin,
1874), and to his recently published <cite>Literarische Fehden im
vierten Jahrhundert vor Chr.</cite> (Breslau, 1881). The chief
points of the former work are, that Plato was really a pantheist
or monist, not, as is commonly believed and as I have
myself taken for granted, a dualist; that, as a consequence
of the suppression of individuality which characterises his
system, he did not really accept or teach the doctrine of
personal immortality, although he wished that the mass of
the people should believe it; that Plato no more attributed
a transcendent existence to his ideas than did Aristotle to his
substantial forms; and that in putting an opposite interpretation
on his old master’s theory, Aristotle is guilty of
gross misrepresentation. The most important point of the
<cite>Literarische Fehden</cite> is that Aristotle published his <cite>Ethics</cite><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xix">xix</span>
while Plato was still alive and engaged in the composition of
his <cite>Laws</cite>, and that certain passages in the latter work, of
which one relates to free-will and the other to the unity of
virtue (861, A ff. and 962 ff.) were intended as a reply to
Aristotle’s well-known criticisms on the Platonic theory of
ethics.</p>

<p>I have been necessarily brief in my statement of Teichmüller’s
theses; and to judge of them apart from the facts
and arguments by which they are supported in the two very
interesting volumes above named would be in the highest
degree unfair. I feel bound, however, to mention the chief
reasons which make me hesitate to accept his conclusions.
It seems to me, then, that although Plato was moving in the
direction of pantheism&mdash;as I have myself pointed out in
more than one passage of this work&mdash;he never actually
reached it. For (i.) he does not, like Plotinus, attempt to
deduce his material from his ideal principle, but only blends
without reconciling them in the world of sensible experience.
(ii.) In opposing the perishable nature of the individual (or
rather the particular) to the eternal nature of the universal,
he is going on the facts of experience rather than on any
necessary opposition between the two, and on experience of
material or sensible objects rather than of immaterial souls;
while, even as regards material objects, the heavenly bodies,
to which he attributes everlasting duration, constitute such a
sweeping exception to his rule as entirely to destroy its
applicability. (iii.) Plato’s multiplied and elaborate arguments
for the immortality of the soul would be superfluous
were his only object to prove that the soul, like everything
else, contains an eternal element. (iv.) The Pythagorean
theory that the soul is a harmony, which Plato rejects, would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xx">xx</span>
have been perfectly compatible with the ideal and impersonal
immortality which Teichmüller supposes him to have taught;
for while the particular harmony perishes, the general laws of
harmony remain. (v.) Teichmüller does not dispose satisfactorily
of Plato’s crowning argument that the idea of life is
as inseparable from the soul as heat from fire or cold from
snow. He says (<cite>op. cit.</cite>, p. 134) that, on this principle, the
individual soul may still perish, just as particular portions of
fire are extinguished and particular portions of snow are
melted. Yes, but portions of fire do not grow cold, nor
portions of snow hot, which and which alone would offer an
analogy to the extinction of a soul.</p>

<p>I agree, however, with Teichmüller that the doctrines of
reminiscence and metempsychosis have a purely mythical
significance, and I should have expressed my views on the
subject with more definiteness and decision had I known that
his authority might be quoted in their support. I think that
Plato was in a transition state from the Oriental to what
afterwards became the Christian theory of retribution. In
the one he found an allegorical illustration of his metaphysics,
in the other a very serious sanction for his ethics. He felt
their incompatibility, but was not prepared to undertake such
a complete reconstruction of his system as would have been
necessitated by altogether denying the pre-existence of the
soul. Of such vacillation Plato’s later Dialogues offer, I think,
sufficient evidence. For example, the Matter of the <cite>Timacus</cite>
seems to be a revised version of the Other or principle of
division and change, which has already figured as a pure idea,
in which capacity it must necessarily be opposed to matter.
At the same time, I must observe that, from my point of view,
it is enough if Plato inculcated the doctrine of a future life as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxi">xxi</span>
an important element of his religious system. And that he
did so inculcate it Teichmüller fully admits.<a id="FNanchor_4_4" href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>With regard to the <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite>, I think Teichmüller
has proved this much, that it was written before
Aristotle had read the <cite>Laws</cite> or knew of its existence. But
this does not prove that he wrote it during Plato’s lifetime,
since the <cite>Laws</cite> was not published until after Plato’s death,
possibly not until several years after. And, published or not,
Aristotle may very well have remained ignorant of its existence
until his return to Athens, which, according to the
tradition, took place about 336 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> Teichmüller does, indeed,
suppose that Aristotle spent some time in Athens between
his flight from Mitylênê and his engagement as tutor to
Alexander (<cite>Literarische Fehden</cite>, p. 261). But this theory,
besides its purely conjectural character, would still allow the
possibility of Aristotle’s having remained unacquainted with
the <cite>Laws</cite> up to the age of forty. And it is obvious that the
passages which Teichmüller interprets as replies to Aristotle’s
criticisms admit of more than one alternative explanation.
They may have originated in doubts and difficulties which
spontaneously suggested themselves to Plato in the course of
his independent reflections; or, granting that there is a
polemic reference, it may have been provoked by some other
critic, or by the spoken criticisms of Aristotle himself. For
the supposition that Aristotle wrote his <cite>Ethics</cite> at the early
age of thirty-two or thirty-three seems to me so improbable
that we should not accept it except under pressure of the
strongest evidence. That a work of such matured thought
and observation should have been produced by so young a
man is, so far as I know, a phenomenon unparalleled in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxii">xxii</span>
history of literature. And to this we must add the further
circumstance that the Greek mind was not particularly
remarkable for precocity in any field except war and statesmanship.
We do, indeed, find instances of comparatively
juvenile authorship, but none, I believe, of a Greek writer,
whether poet, historian, or philosopher, who reached the full
maturity of his powers before a considerably advanced period
of middle age. That the <cite>Ethics</cite> is very imperfect I fully
admit, and have expressly maintained against its numerous
admirers in the course of this work. But, although imperfect,
it is not crude. It contains as good a discussion of the subject
undertaken as Aristotle was ever capable of giving, and its
limitations are not those of an unripe intellect, but of an
intellect at all times comparatively unsuited for the treatment
of practical problems, and narrowed still further by the
requirements of an elaborate speculative system. Now to
work out this system must have demanded considerably more
labour and independent thought than one can suppose even
an Aristotle to have found time for before thirty-three; while
the experience of life shown in the <cite>Ethics</cite> is such as study,
so far from supplying, would, on the contrary, have delayed.
Moreover, the <cite>Rhetoric</cite>, which was confessedly written before
the <cite>Ethics</cite>, exhibits the same qualities in about an equal
degree, and therefore, on Teichmüller’s theory, testifies to a
still more extraordinary precocity. And there is the further
circumstance that while Aristotle is known to have begun his
public career as a teacher of rhetoric, his earliest productions
seem to have been of a rather diffuse and declamatory
character, quite opposed to the severe concision which marks
the style both of the <cite>Rhetoric</cite> and of the <cite>Ethics</cite>. In addition
to these general considerations, one may mention that in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiii">xxiii</span>
well-known passage of the <cite>Ethics</cite>, referring to a question of
logical method (I., iv.), Plato is spoken of in the imperfect
tense, which would seem to imply that he was no longer
living when it was written. Speaking from memory, I should
even be inclined to doubt whether the mention of a living
writer by name at all is consistent with Aristotle’s standard
of literary etiquette.</p>

<p>These are difficulties which Teichmüller has, no doubt,
fully weighed and put aside as not sufficiently strong to
invalidate his conclusions. I have stated them in order to
show that enough can be said for the old view to justify the
republication of what was written on the assumption of its
unquestionable truth. Moreover, researches conducted with
so much skill and learning as those of Teichmüller demand
some public acknowledgment in a work like the present, even
when the results are such that the writer cannot see his way
to accepting them as satisfactorily made out. There are many
English scholars more competent than I am to discuss the
whole question at issue. Perhaps these lines may induce
some of them to give it the attention which it merits, but
which, in England at least, it does not seem to have as yet
received.</p>

<p>My obligations to other writers have been acknowledged
throughout this work, so far as I was conscious of them, and
so far as they could be defined by reference to specific points.
I take the present opportunity for mentioning in a more
general way the valuable assistance which I have derived
from Schwegler’s <cite>Geschichte der Griechischen Philosophie</cite>,
Lange’s <cite>Geschichte des Materialismus</cite>, and Dühring’s <cite>Geschichte
der Philosophie</cite>. The parallel between Socrates,
Giordano Bruno, and Spinoza was probably suggested to me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiv">xxiv</span>
by Dühring, as also were some points in my characterisation
of Aristotle. As my view of the position occupied by
Lucretius with respect to religion and philosophy differs in
many important points from that of Prof. Sellar, it is the
more incumbent on me to state that, but for a perusal of
Prof. Sellar’s eloquent and sympathetic chapters on the great
Epicurean poet, my own estimate of his genius would certainly
not have been written in its present form and would probably
not have been written at all.</p>

<p>On the whole, I am afraid that my acquaintance with the
modern literature of the subject will be found rather limited
for an undertaking like the present. But I do not think that
wider reading in that direction would have much furthered the
object I had in view. That object has been to exhibit the
principal ideas of Greek philosophy in the closest possible
connexion with the characters of their authors, with each
other, with their developments in modern speculation, with
the parallel tendencies of literature and art, with the history
of religion, of physical science, and of civilisation as a whole.
To interpret all things by a system of universal references is
the method of philosophy; when applied to a series of events
this method is the philosophy of history; when the events
are ideas, it is the philosophy of philosophy itself.</p>

<p class="half-title">THE GREEK PHILOSOPHERS.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a><br />

<small>EARLY GREEK THOUGHT.</small></h2>


<h3><a id="I-I"></a>I.</h3>

<p>During the two centuries that ended with the close of the
Peloponnesian war, a single race, weak numerically, and
weakened still further by political disunion, simultaneously
developed all the highest human faculties to an extent possibly
rivalled but certainly not surpassed by the collective efforts
of that vastly greater population which now wields the accumulated
resources of modern Europe. This race, while maintaining
a precarious foothold on the shores of the Mediterranean
by repeated prodigies of courage and genius, contributed
a new element to civilisation which has been the mainspring
of all subsequent progress, but which, as it expanded
into wider circles and encountered an increasing resistance
from without, unavoidably lost some of the enormous elasticity
that characterised its earliest and most concentrated
reaction. It was the just boast of the Greek that to Asiatic
refinement and Thracian valour he joined a disinterested
thirst for knowledge unshared by his neighbours on either
side.<a id="FNanchor_5_5" href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> And if a contemporary of Pericles could have
foreseen all that would be thought, and said, and done during<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
the next twenty-three centuries of this world’s existence, at
no period during that long lapse of ages, not even among the
kindred Italian race, could he have found a competitor to
contest with Hellas the olive crown of a nobler Olympia, the
guerdon due to a unique combination of supreme excellence
in every variety of intellectual exercise, in strategy, diplomacy,
statesmanship; in mathematical science, architecture, plastic
art, and poetry; in the severe fidelity of the historian whose
paramount object is to relate facts as they have occurred, and
the dexterous windings of the advocate whose interest leads
him to evade or to disguise them; in the far-reaching
meditations of the lonely thinker grappling with the enigmas
of his own soul, and the fervid eloquence by which a
multitude on whose decision hang great issues is inspired,
directed, or controlled. He would not, it is true, have
found any single Greek to pit against the athletes of the
Renaissance; there were none who displayed that universal
genius so characteristic of the greatest Tuscan artists such as
Lionardo and Michael Angelo; nor, to take a much narrower
range, did a single Greek writer whose compositions have
come down to us excel, or even attempt to excel, in poetry
and prose alike. But our imaginary prophet might have
observed that such versatility better befitted a sophist like
Hippias or an adventurer like Critias than an earnest master
of the Pheidian type. He might have quoted Pindar’s
sarcasm about highly educated persons who have an infinity
of tastes and bring none of them to perfection;<a id="FNanchor_6_6" href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> holding, as
Plato did in the next generation, that one man can only do
one thing well, he might have added that the heroes of
modern art would have done much nobler work had they
concentrated their powers on a single task instead of
attempting half a dozen and leaving most of them incomplete.</p>

<p>This careful restriction of individual effort to a single<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
province involved no dispersion or incoherence in the results
achieved. The highest workers were all animated by a common
spirit. Each represented some one aspect of the glory and
greatness participated in by all. Nor was the collective consciousness,
the uniting sympathy, limited to a single sphere.
It rose, by a graduated series, from the city community,
through the Dorian or Ionian stock with which they claimed
more immediate kinship, to the Panhellenic race, the whole
of humanity, and the divine fatherhood of Zeus, until it
rested in that all-embracing nature which Pindar knew as the
one mother of gods and men.<a id="FNanchor_7_7" href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>We may, perhaps, find some suggestion of this combined
distinctness and comprehensiveness in the aspect and configuration
of Greece itself; in its manifold varieties of soil,
and climate, and scenery, and productions; in the exquisite
clearness with which the features of its landscape are defined;
and the admirable development of coast-line by
which all parts of its territory, while preserving their political
independence, were brought into safe and speedy communication
with one another. The industrial and commercial habits
of the people, necessitating a well-marked division of labour
and a regulated distribution of commodities, gave a further
impulse in the same direction.</p>

<p>But what afforded the most valuable education in this
sense was their system of free government, involving, as it
did, the supremacy of an impersonal law, the subdivision of
public authority among a number of magistrates, and the
assignment to each of certain carefully defined functions
which he was forbidden to exceed; together with the living
interest felt by each citizen in the welfare of the whole state,
and that conception of it as a whole composed of various
parts, which is impossible where all the public powers are
collected in a single hand.</p>

<p>A people so endowed were the natural creators of philo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>sophy.
There came a time when the harmonious universality
of the Hellenic genius sought for its counterpart and completion
in a theory of the external world. And there came a
time, also, when the decay of political interests left a large
fund of intellectual energy, accustomed to work under certain
conditions, with the desire to realise those conditions in an
ideal sphere. Such is the most general significance we can
attach to that memorable series of speculations on the nature
of things which, beginning in Ionia, was carried by the Greek
colonists to Italy and Sicily, whence, after receiving important
additions and modifications, the stream of thought
flowed back into the old country, where it was directed into
an entirely new channel by the practical genius of Athens.
Thales and his successors down to Democritus were not
exactly what we should call philosophers, in any sense of the
word that would include a Locke or a Hume, and exclude a
Boyle or a Black; for their speculations never went beyond
the confines of the material universe; they did not even suspect
the existence of those ethical and dialectical problems
which long constituted the sole object of philosophical discussion,
and have continued since the time when they were
first mooted to be regarded as its most peculiar province.
Nor yet can we look on them altogether or chiefly as men of
science, for their paramount purpose was to gather up the
whole of knowledge under a single principle; and they
sought to realise this purpose, not by observation and experiment,
but by the power of thought alone. It would, perhaps,
be truest to say that from their point of view philosophy and
science were still undifferentiated, and that knowledge as a
universal synthesis was not yet divorced from special investigations
into particular orders of phenomena. Here, as elsewhere,
advancing reason tends to reunite studies which have
been provisionally separated, and we must look to our own
contemporaries—to our Tyndalls and Thomsons, our Helmholtzes
and Zöllners—as furnishing the fittest parallel to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
Anaximander and Empedocles, Leucippus and Diogenes of
Apollonia.</p>

<p>It has been the fashion in certain quarters to look down
on these early thinkers—to depreciate the value of their
speculations because they were thinkers, because, as we have
already noticed, they reached their most important conclusions
by thinking, the means of truly scientific observation
not being within their reach. Nevertheless, they performed
services to humanity comparable for value with the legislation
of Solon and Cleisthenes, or the victories of Marathon and
Salamis; while their creative imagination was not inferior to
that of the great lyric and dramatic poets, the great architects
and sculptors, whose contemporaries they were. They first
taught men to distinguish between the realities of nature and
the illusions of sense; they discovered or divined the indestructibility
of matter and its atomic constitution; they
taught that space is infinite, a conception so far from being
self-evident that it transcended the capacity of Aristotle to
grasp; they held that the seemingly eternal universe was
brought into its present form by the operation of mechanical
forces which will also effect its dissolution; confronted by the
seeming permanence and solidity of our planet, with the
innumerable varieties of life to be found on its surface, they
declared that all things had arisen by differentiation<a id="FNanchor_8_8" href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> from a
homogeneous attenuated vapour; while one of them went so
far as to surmise that man is descended from an aquatic
animal. But higher still than these fragmentary glimpses
and anticipations of a theory which still awaits confirmation
from experience, we must place their central doctrine, that
the universe is a cosmos, an ordered whole governed by
number and law, not a blind conflict of semi-conscious agents,
or a theatre for the arbitrary interference of partial, jealous,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
and vindictive gods; that its changes are determined, if at
all, by an immanent unchanging reason; and that those
celestial luminaries which had drawn to themselves in every
age the unquestioning worship of all mankind were, in truth,
nothing more than fiery masses of inanimate matter. Thus,
even if the early Greek thinkers were not scientific, they first
made science possible by substituting for a theory of the
universe which is its direct negation, one that methodised
observation has increasingly tended to confirm. The garland
of poetic praise woven by Lucretius for his adored master
should have been dedicated to them, and to them alone. His
noble enthusiasm was really inspired by their lessons, not by
the wearisome trifling of a moralist who knew little and cared
less about those studies in which the whole soul of his
Roman disciple was absorbed.</p>

<p>When the power and value of these primitive speculations
can no longer be denied, their originality is sometimes questioned
by the systematic detractors of everything Hellenic.
Thales and the rest, we are told, simply borrowed their
theories without acknowledgment from a storehouse of
Oriental wisdom on which the Greeks are supposed to have
drawn as freely as Coleridge drew on German philosophy.
Sometimes each system is affiliated to one of the great
Asiatic religions; sometimes they are all traced back to the
schools of Hindostan. It is natural that no two critics
should agree, when the rival explanations are based on nothing
stronger than superficial analogies and accidental coincidences.
Dr. Zeller in his wonderfully learned, clear, and
sagacious work on Greek philosophy, has carefully sifted some
of the hypotheses referred to, and shown how destitute they
are of internal or external evidence, and how utterly they fail
to account for the facts. The oldest and best authorities,
Plato and Aristotle, knew nothing about such a derivation
of Greek thought from Eastern sources. Isocrates does,
indeed, mention that Pythagoras borrowed his philosophy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
from Egypt, but Isocrates did not even pretend to be a
truthful narrator. No Greek of the early period except
those regularly domiciled in Susa seems to have been
acquainted with any language but his own. Few travelled
very far into Asia, and of those few, only one or two were
philosophers. Democritus, who visited more foreign countries
than any man of his time, speaks only of having discussed
mathematical problems with the wise men whom he encountered;
and even in mathematics he was at least their
equal.<a id="FNanchor_9_9" href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> It was precisely at the greatest distance from Asia,
in Italy and Sicily, that the systems arose which seem to
have most analogy with Asiatic modes of thought. Can we
suppose that the traders of those times were in any way
qualified to transport the speculations of Confucius and the
Vedas to such a distance from their native homes? With far
better reason might one expect a German merchant to carry
a knowledge of Kant’s philosophy from Königsberg to
Canton. But a more convincing argument than any is to
show that Greek philosophy in its historical evolution exhibits
a perfectly natural and spontaneous progress from
simpler to more complex forms, and that system grew out of
system by a strictly logical process of extension, analysis, and
combination. This is what, chiefly under the guidance of
Zeller, we shall now attempt to do.</p>


<h3><a id="I-II"></a>II.</h3>

<p>Thales, of Miletus, an Ionian geometrician and astronomer,
about whose age considerable uncertainty prevails, but who
seems to have flourished towards the close of the seventh
century before our era, is by general consent regarded as the
father of Greek physical philosophy. Others before him
had attempted to account for the world’s origin, but none
like him had traced it back to a purely natural beginning.
According to Thales all things have come from water. That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
the earth is entirely enclosed by water above and below as well
as all round was perhaps a common notion among the Western
Asiatics. It was certainly believed by the Hebrews, as we
learn from the accounts of the creation and the flood contained
in Genesis. The Milesian thinker showed his originality
by generalising still further and declaring that not only
did water surround all things, but that all things were derived
from it as their first cause and substance, that water was, so
to speak, the material absolute. Never have more pregnant
words been spoken; they acted like a ferment on the Greek
mind; they were the grain whence grew a tree that has overshadowed
the whole earth. At one stroke they substituted a
comparatively scientific, because a verifiable principle for the
confused fancies of mythologising poets. Not that Thales
was an atheist, or an agnostic, or anything of that sort. On
the contrary, he is reported to have said that all things were
full of gods; and the report sounds credible enough. Most
probably the saying was a protest against the popular limitation
of divine agencies to certain special occasions and favoured
localities. A true thinker seeks above all for consistency and
continuity. He will more readily accept a perpetual stream
of creative energy than a series of arbitrary and isolated interferences
with the course of Nature. For the rest, Thales
made no attempt to explain how water came to be transformed
into other substances, nor is it likely that the necessity
of such an explanation had ever occurred to him. We may
suspect that he and others after him were not capable of distinguishing
very clearly between such notions as space, time,
cause, substance, and limit. It is almost as difficult for us to
enter into the thoughts of these primitive philosophers as it
would have been for them to comprehend processes of reasoning
already familiar to Plato and Aristotle. Possibly the
forms under which we arrange our conceptions may become
equally obsolete at a more advanced stage of intellectual
evolution, and our sharp distinctions may prove to be not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
less artificial than the confused identifications which they
have superseded.</p>

<p>The next great forward step in speculation was taken by
Anaximander, another Milesian, also of distinguished attainments
in mathematics and astronomy. We have seen that to
Thales water, the all-embracing element, became, as such, the
first cause of all things, the absolute principle of existence.
His successor adopted the same general point of view, but
looked out from it with a more penetrating gaze. Beyond
water lay something else which he called the Infinite. He
did not mean the empty abstraction which has stalked about
in modern times under that ill-omened name, nor yet did he
mean infinite space, but something richer and more concrete
than either; a storehouse of materials whence the waste of
existence could be perpetually made good. The growth and
decay of individual forms involve a ceaseless drain on Nature,
and the deficiency must be supplied by a corresponding influx
from without.<span class="ref"><a href="#A">A</a></span> For, be it observed that, although the Greek
thinkers were at this period well aware that nothing can come
from nothing, they had not yet grasped the complementary
truth inalienably wedded to it by Lucretius in one immortal
couplet, that nothing can return to nothing; and Kant is
quite mistaken when he treats the two as historically inseparable.
Common experience forces the one on our attention
much sooner than the other. Our incomings are very
strictly measured out and accounted for without difficulty,
while it is hard to tell what becomes of all our expenditure,
physical and economical. Yet, although the indestructibility
of matter was a conception which had not yet dawned on
Anaximander, he seems to have been feeling his way towards
the recognition of a circulatory movement pervading all
Nature. Everything, he says, must at last be reabsorbed in
the Infinite as a punishment for the sin of its separate existence.<a id="FNanchor_10_10" href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>
Some may find in this sentiment a note of Oriental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
mysticism. Rather does its very sadness illustrate the healthy
vitality of Greek feeling, to which absorption seemed like the
punishment of a crime against the absolute, and not, as to so
many Asiatics, the crown and consummation of spiritual perfection.
Be this as it may, a doctrine which identified the
death of the whole world with its reabsorption into a higher
reality would soon suggest the idea that its component parts
vanish only to reappear in new combinations.</p>

<p>Anaximander’s system was succeeded by a number of
others which cannot be arranged according to any order of
linear progression. Such arrangements are, indeed, false in
principle. Intellectual life, like every other life, is a product
of manifold conditions, and their varied combinations are certain
to issue in a corresponding multiplicity of effects. Anaximenes,
a fellow-townsman of Anaximander, followed most
closely in the footsteps of the master. Attempting, as it
would appear, to mediate between his two predecessors, he
chose air for a primal element. Air is more omnipresent than
water, which, as well as earth, is enclosed within its plastic
sphere. On the other hand, it is more tangible and concrete
than the Infinite, or may even be substituted for that conception
by supposing it to extend as far as thought can reach.
As before, cosmogony grows out of cosmography; the enclosing
element is the parent of those embraced within it.</p>

<p>Speculation now leaves its Asiatic cradle and travels with
the Greek colonists to new homes in Italy and Sicily, where
new modes of thought were fostered by a new environment.
A name, round which mythical accretions have gathered so
thickly that the original nucleus of fact almost defies definition,
first claims our attention. Aristotle, as is well known,
avoids mentioning Pythagoras, and always speaks of the
Pythagoreans when he is discussing the opinions held by a
certain Italian school. Their doctrine, whoever originated it,
was that all things are made out of number. Brandis regards
Pythagoreanism as an entirely original effort of speculation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
standing apart from the main current of Hellenic thought, and
to be studied without reference to Ionian philosophy. Zeller,
with more plausibility, treats it as an outgrowth of Anaximander’s
system. In that system the finite and the infinite
remained opposed to one another as unreconciled moments of
thought. Number, according to the Greek arithmeticians, was
a synthesis of the two, and therefore superior to either. To a
Pythagorean the finite and the infinite were only one among
several antithetical couples, such as odd and even, light and
darkness, male and female, and, above all, the one and the
many whence every number after unity is formed. The
tendency to search for antitheses everywhere, and to manufacture
them where they do not exist, became ere long an actual
disease of the Greek mind. A Thucydides could no more
have dispensed with this cumbrous mechanism than a rope-dancer
could get on without his balancing pole; and many a
schoolboy has been sorely puzzled by the fantastic contortions
which Italiote reflection imposed for a time on Athenian
oratory.</p>

<p>Returning to our more immediate subject, we must observe
that the Pythagoreans did not maintain, in anticipation
of modern quantitative science, that all things are determined
by number, but that all things are numbers, or are made out
of numbers, two propositions not easily distinguished by
unpractised thinkers. Numbers, in a word, were to them
precisely what water had been to Thales, what air was to
Anaximenes, the absolute principle of existence; only with
them the idea of a limit, the leading inspiration of Greek
thought, had reached a higher degree of abstraction. Number
was, as it were, the exterior limit of the finite, and the interior
limit of the infinite. Add to this that mathematical
studies, cultivated in Egypt and Phoenicia for their practical
utility alone, were being pursued in Hellas with ever-increasing
ardour for the sake of their own delightfulness, for the
intellectual discipline that they supplied—a discipline even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
more valuable then than now, and for the insight which they
bestowed, or were believed to bestow, into the secret constitution
of Nature; and that the more complicated arithmetical
operations were habitually conducted with the aid of geometrical
diagrams, thus suggesting the possibility of applying
a similar treatment to every order of relations. Consider the
lively emotions excited among an intelligent people at a time
when multiplication and division, squaring and cubing, the
rule of three, the construction and equivalence of figures, with
all their manifold applications to industry, commerce, fine art,
and tactics, were just as strange and wonderful as electrical
phenomena are to us; consider also the magical influence
still commonly attributed to particular numbers, and the
intense eagerness to obtain exact numerical statements, even
when they are of no practical value, exhibited by all who
are thrown back on primitive ways of living, as, for example,
in Alpine travelling, or on board an Atlantic steamer, and we
shall cease to wonder that a mere form of thought, a lifeless
abstraction, should once have been regarded as the solution
of every problem, the cause of all existence; or that these
speculations were more than once revived in after ages, and
perished only with Greek philosophy itself.</p>

<p>We have not here to examine the scientific achievements
of Pythagoras and his school; they belong to the history
of science, not to that of pure thought, and therefore lie outside
the present discussion. Something, however, must be
said of Pythagoreanism as a scheme of moral, religious, and
social reform. Alone among the pre-Socratic systems, it
undertook to furnish a rule of conduct as well as a theory of
being. Yet, as Zeller has pointed out,<a id="FNanchor_11_11" href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> it was only an apparent
anomaly, for the ethical teaching of the Pythagoreans
was not based on their physical theories, except in so far
as a deep reverence for law and order was common to both.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
Perhaps, also, the separation of soul and body, with the
ascription of a higher dignity to the former, which was a
distinctive tenet of the school, may be paralleled with the
position given to number as a kind of spiritual power creating
and controlling the world of sense. So also political power
was to be entrusted to an aristocracy trained in every noble
accomplishment, and fitted for exercising authority over
others by self-discipline, by mutual fidelity, and by habitual
obedience to a rule of right. Nevertheless, we must look,
with Zeller, for the true source of Pythagoreanism as a moral
movement in that great wave of religious enthusiasm which
swept over Hellas during the sixth century before Christ,
intimately associated with the importation of Apollo-worship
from Lycia, with the concentration of spiritual authority in
the oracular shrine of Delphi, and the political predominance
of the Dorian race, those Normans of the ancient world.
Legend has thrown this connexion into a poetical form by
making Pythagoras the son of Apollo; and the Samian sage,
although himself an Ionian, chose the Dorian cities of
Southern Italy as a favourable field for his new teaching,
just as Calvinism found a readier acceptance in the advanced
posts of the Teutonic race than among the people
whence its founder sprang. Perhaps the nearest parallel,
although on a far more extensive scale, for the religious
movement of which we are speaking, is the spectacle offered
by mediaeval Europe during the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries of our era, when a series of great Popes had concentrated
all spiritual power in their own hands, and were
sending forth army after army of Crusaders to the East;
when all Western Europe had awakened to the consciousness
of its common Christianity, and each individual was thrilled
by a sense of the tremendous alternatives committed to his
choice; when the Dominican and Franciscan orders were
founded; when Gothic architecture and Florentine painting
arose; when the Troubadours and Minnesängers were pour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>ing
out their notes of scornful or tender passion, and the
love of the sexes had become a sentiment as lofty and
enduring as the devotion of friend to friend had been in
Greece of old. The bloom of Greek religious enthusiasm
was more exquisite and evanescent than that of feudal
Catholicism; inferior in pure spirituality and of more restricted
significance as a factor in the evolution of humanity,
it at least remained free from the ecclesiastical tyranny, the
murderous fanaticism, and the unlovely superstitions of
mediaeval faith. But polytheism under any form was fatally
incapable of coping with the new spirit of enquiry awakened
by philosophy, and the old myths, with their naturalistic
crudities, could not long satisfy the reason and conscience
of thinkers who had learned in another school to seek
everywhere for a central unity of control, and to bow their
imaginations before the passionless perfection of eternal
law.</p>


<h3><a id="I-III"></a>III.</h3>

<p>Such a thinker was Xenophanes, of Colophon. Driven,
like Pythagoras, from his native city by civil discords, he
spent the greater part of an unusually protracted life wandering
through the Greek colonies of Sicily and Southern Italy,
and reciting his own verses, not always, as it would appear, to
a very attentive audience. Elea, an Italiote city, seems to
have been his favourite resort, and the school of philosophy
which he founded there has immortalised the name of this
otherwise obscure Phocaean settlement. Enough remains of
his verses to show with what terrible strength of sarcasm he
assailed the popular religion of Hellas. ‘Homer and Hesiod,’
he exclaims, ‘have attributed to the gods everything that is a
shame and reproach among men—theft, adultery, and mutual
deception.’<a id="FNanchor_12_12" href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> Nor is Xenophanes content with attacking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
these unedifying stories, he strikes at the anthropomorphic
conceptions which lay at their root. ‘Mortals think that the
gods have senses, and a voice and a body like their own.
The negroes fancy that their deities are black-skinned and
snub-nosed, the Thracians give theirs fair hair and blue eyes;
if horses or lions had hands and could paint, they too would
make gods in their own image.’<a id="FNanchor_13_13" href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> It was, he declared, as
impious to believe in the birth of a god as to believe in the
possibility of his death. The current polytheism was equally
false. ‘There is one Supreme God among gods and men,
unlike mortals both in mind and body.’<a id="FNanchor_14_14" href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> There can be only
one God, for God is Omnipotent, so that there must be none
to dispute his will. He must also be perfectly homogeneous,
shaped like a sphere, seeing, hearing, and thinking with every
part alike, never moving from place to place, but governing
all things by an effortless exercise of thought. Had such
daring heresies been promulgated in democratic Athens, their
author would probably have soon found himself and his
works handed over to the tender mercies of the Eleven.
Happily at Elea, and in most other Greek states, the gods
were left to take care of themselves.</p>

<p>Xenophanes does not seem to have been ever molested
on account of his religious opinions. He complains bitterly
enough that people preferred fiction to philosophy, that
uneducated athletes engrossed far too much popular admiration,
that he, Xenophanes, was not sufficiently appreciated;<span class="ref"><a href="#B">B</a></span>
but of theological intolerance, so far as our information goes,
he says not one single word. It will easily be conceived that
the rapid progress of Greek speculation was singularly
favoured by such unbounded freedom of thought and speech.
The views just set forth have often been regarded as a step
towards spiritualistic monotheism, and so, considered in the
light of subsequent developments, they unquestionably were.
Still, looking at the matter from another aspect, we may say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
that Xenophanes, when he shattered the idols of popular
religion, was returning to the past rather than anticipating
the future; feeling his way back to the deeper, more primordial
faith of the old Aryan race, or even of that still older
stock whence Aryan and Turanian alike diverged. He turns
from the brilliant, passionate, fickle Dyaus, to Zên, or Ten,
the ever-present, all-seeing, all-embracing, immovable vault of
heaven. Aristotle, with a sympathetic insight unfortunately
too rare in his criticisms on earlier systems, observes that
Xenophanes did not make it clear whether the absolute unity
he taught was material or ideal, but simply looked up at the
whole heaven and declared that the One was God.<a id="FNanchor_15_15" href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> Aristotle
was himself the real creator of philosophic monotheism, just
because the idea of living, self-conscious personality had a
greater value, a profounder meaning for him than for any
other thinker of antiquity, one may almost say than for any
other thinker whatever. It is, therefore, a noteworthy circumstance
that, while warmly acknowledging the anticipations of
Anaxagoras, he nowhere speaks of Xenophanes as a predecessor
in the same line of enquiry. The latter might be
called a pantheist were it not that pantheism belongs to a
much later stage of speculation, one, in fact, not reached by
the Greek mind at any period of its development. His
leading conception was obscured by a confusion of mythological
with purely physical ideas, and could only bear full
fruit when the religious element had been entirely eliminated
from its composition. This elimination was accomplished by
a far greater thinker, one who combined poetic inspiration
with philosophic depth; who was penetrating enough to
discern the logical consequences involved in a fundamental
principle of thought, and bold enough to push them to their
legitimate conclusions without caring for the shock to sense
and common opinion that his merciless dialectic might
inflict.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span></p>

<p>Parmenides, of Elea, flourished towards the beginning of
the fifth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> We know very little about his personal
history. According to Plato, he visited Athens late in life,
and there made the acquaintance of Socrates, at that time a
very young man. But an unsupported statement of Plato’s
must always be received with extreme caution; and this
particular story is probably not less fictitious than the
dialogue which it serves to introduce. Parmenides embodied
his theory of the world in a poem, the most important
passages of which have been preserved. They show that,
while continuing the physical studies of his predecessors, he
proceeded on an entirely different method. Their object
was to deduce every variety of natural phenomena from a
fundamental unity of substance. He declared that all
variety and change were a delusion, and that nothing existed
but one indivisible, unalterable, absolute reality; just as
Descartes’ antithesis of thought and extension disappeared
in the infinite substance of Spinoza, or as the Kantian
dualism of object and subject was eliminated in Hegel’s
absolute idealism. Again, Parmenides does not dogmatise
to the same extent as his predecessors; he attempts to
demonstrate his theory by the inevitable necessities of being
and thought. Existence, he tells us over and over again, <em>is</em>,
and non-existence is not, cannot even be imagined or thought
of as existing, for thought is the same as being. This is
not an anticipation of Hegel’s identification of being with
thought; it only amounts to the very innocent proposition
that a thought is something and about something—enters,
therefore, into the general undiscriminated mass of being.
He next proceeds to prove that what is can neither come
into being nor pass out of it again. It cannot come out of
the non-existent, for that is inconceivable; nor out of the
existent, for nothing exists but being itself; and the same
argument proves that it cannot cease to exist. Here we find
the indestructibility of matter, a truth which Anaximander<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
had not yet grasped, virtually affirmed for the first time in
history. We find also that our philosopher is carried away
by the enthusiasm of a new discovery, and covers more
ground than he can defend in maintaining the permanence of
all existence whatever. The reason is that to him, as to
every other thinker of the pre-Socratic period, all existence
was material, or, rather, all reality was confounded under
one vague conception, of which visible resisting extension
supplied the most familiar type. To proceed: Being cannot
be divided from being, nor is it capable of condensation or
expansion (as the Ionians had taught); there is nothing by
which it can be separated or held apart; nor is it ever more
or less existent, but all is full of being. Parmenides goes on
in his grand style:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">‘Therefore the whole extends continuously,</div>
  <div class="verse">Being by Being set; immovable,</div>
  <div class="verse">Subject to the constraint of mighty laws;</div>
  <div class="verse">Both increate and indestructible,</div>
  <div class="verse">Since birth and death have wandered far away</div>
  <div class="verse">By true conviction into exile driven;</div>
  <div class="verse">The same, in self-same place, and by itself</div>
  <div class="verse">Abiding, doth abide most firmly fixed,</div>
  <div class="verse">And bounded round by strong Necessity.</div>
  <div class="verse">Wherefore a holy law forbids that Being</div>
  <div class="verse">Should be without an end, else want were there,</div>
  <div class="verse">And want of that would be a want of all.’<a id="FNanchor_16_16" href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Thus does the everlasting Greek love of order, definition,
limitation, reassert its supremacy over the intelligence of this
noble thinker, just as his almost mystical enthusiasm has
reached its highest pitch of exaltation, giving him back a
world which thought can measure, circumscribe, and control.</p>

<p>Being, then, is finite in extent, and, as a consequence of
its absolute homogeneity, spherical in form. There is good
reason for believing that the earth’s true figure was first
discovered in the fifth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, but whether it was
suggested by the <i lang="la">à priori</i> theories of Parmenides, or was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
generalised by him into a law of the whole universe, or
whether there was more than an accidental connexion
between the two hypotheses, we cannot tell. Aristotle, at
any rate, was probably as much indebted to the Eleatic system
as to contemporary astronomy for his theory of a finite spherical
universe. It will easily be observed that the distinction
between space and matter, so obvious to us, and even to
Greek thinkers of a later date, had not yet dawned upon
Parmenides. As applied to the former conception, most of
his affirmations are perfectly correct, but his belief in the
finiteness of Being can only be justified on the supposition
that Being is identified with matter. For it must be clearly
understood (and Zeller has the great merit of having proved
this fact by incontrovertible arguments)<a id="FNanchor_17_17" href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> that the Eleatic
Being was not a transcendental conception, nor an abstract
unity, as Aristotle erroneously supposed, nor a Kantian
noumenon, nor a spiritual essence of any kind, but a
phenomenal reality of the most concrete description. We
can only not call Parmenides a materialist, because
materialism implies a negation of spiritualism, which in his
time had not yet come into existence. He tells us plainly
that a man’s thoughts result from the conformation of his
body, and are determined by the preponderating element in
its composition. Not much, however, can be made of this
rudimentary essay in psychology, connected as it seems to be
with an appendix to the teaching of our philosopher, in
which he accepts the popular dualism, although still convinced
of its falsity, and uses it, under protest, as an explanation of
that very genesis which he had rejected as impossible.</p>

<p>As might be expected, the Parmenidean paradoxes provoked
a considerable amount of contradiction and ridicule.
The Reids and Beatties of that time drew sundry absurd
consequences from the new doctrine, and offered them as a
sufficient refutation of its truth. Zeno, a young friend and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
favourite of Parmenides, took up arms in his master’s defence,
and sought to prove with brilliant dialectical ability that consequences
still more absurd might be deduced from the
opposite belief. He originated a series of famous puzzles
respecting the infinite divisibility of matter and the possibility
of motion, subsequently employed as a disproof of all
certainty by the Sophists and Sceptics, and occasionally
made to serve as arguments on behalf of agnosticism by
writers of our own time. Stated generally, they may be
reduced to two. A whole composed of parts and divisible <i lang="la">ad
infinitum</i> must be either infinitely great or infinitely little;
infinitely great if its parts have magnitude, infinitely little if
they have not. A moving body can never come to the end of
a given line, for it must first traverse half the line, then half the
remainder, and so on for ever. Aristotle thought that the
difficulty about motion could be solved by taking the infinite
divisibility of time into account; and Coleridge, according to
his custom, repeated the explanation without acknowledgment.
But Zeno would have refused to admit that any infinite series
could come to an end, whether it was composed of successive
or of co-existent parts. So long as the abstractions of our
understanding are treated as separate entities, these and
similar puzzles will continue to exercise the ingenuity of
metaphysicians. Our present business, however, is not to
solve Zeno’s difficulties, but to show how they illustrate a
leading characteristic of Greek thought, its tendency to perpetual
analysis, a tendency not limited to the philosophy of
the Greeks, but pervading the whole of their literature and
even of their art. Homer carefully distinguishes the successive
steps of every action, and leads up to every catastrophe
by a series of finely graduated transitions. Like Zeno, again,
he pursues a system of dichotomy, passing rapidly over the
first half of his subject, and relaxes the speed of his narrative
by going into ever-closer detail until the consummation is
reached. Such a poem as the ‘Achilleis’ of modern critics<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
would have been perfectly intolerable to a Greek, from the
too rapid and uniform march of its action. Herodotus proceeds
after a precisely similar fashion, advancing from a broad
and free treatment of history to elaborate minuteness of
detail. So, too, a Greek temple divides itself into parts so
distinct, yet so closely connected, that the eye, after separating,
as easily recombines them into a whole. The evolution of
Greek music tells the same tale of progressive subdivision,
which is also illustrated by the passage from long speeches to
single lines, and from these again to half lines in the dialogue
of a Greek drama. No other people could have created
mathematical demonstration, for no other would have had
skill and patience enough to discover the successive identities
interposed between and connecting the sides of an equation.
The dialectic of Socrates and Plato, the somewhat wearisome
distinctions of Aristotle, and, last of all, the fine-spun series of
triads inserted by Proclus between the superessential One and
the fleeting world of sense,—were all products of the same
fundamental tendency, alternately most fruitful and most
barren in its results. It may be objected that Zeno, so far
from obeying this tendency, followed a diametrically opposite
principle, that of absolutely unbroken continuity. True; but
the ‘Eleatic Palamedes’ fought his adversaries with a weapon
wrested out of their own hands; rejecting analysis as a law of
real existence, he continued to employ it as a logical artifice
with greater subtlety than had ever yet been displayed in
pure speculation.<a id="FNanchor_18_18" href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span></p>

<p>Besides Zeno, Parmenides seems to have had only one
disciple of note, Melissus, the Samian statesman and general;
but under various modifications and combined with other
elements, the Eleatic absolute entered as a permanent factor
into Greek speculation. From it were lineally descended the
Sphairos of Empedocles, the eternal atoms of Leucippus, the
Nous of Anaxagoras, the Megaric Good, the supreme solar
idea of Plato, the self-thinking thought of Aristotle, the imperturbable
tranquillity attributed to their model sage by
Stoics and Epicureans alike, the sovereign indifference of the
Sceptics, and finally, the Neo-platonic One. Modern philosophers
have sought for their supreme ideal in power, movement,
activity, life, rather than in any stationary substance;
yet even among them we find Herbart partially reviving the
Eleatic theory, and confronting Hegel’s fluent categories with
his own inflexible monads.</p>

<p>We have now to study an analogous, though far less complicated,
antagonism in ancient Greece, and to show how her
most brilliant period of physical philosophy arose from the
combination of two seemingly irreconcilable systems. Parmenides,
in an address supposed to be delivered by Wisdom
to her disciple, warns us against the method pursued by
‘ignorant mortals, the blind, deaf, stupid, confused tribes, who
hold that to be and not to be are the same, and that all things
move round by an inverted path.’<a id="FNanchor_19_19" href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> What Parmenides denounced
as arrant nonsense was deliberately proclaimed to be
the highest truth by his illustrious contemporary, Heracleitus,
of Ephesus. This wonderful thinker is popularly known as
the weeping philosopher, because, according to a very
silly tradition, he never went abroad without shedding tears
over the follies of mankind. No such mawkish sentimentality,
but bitter scorn and indignation, marked the attitude of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
Heracleitus towards his fellows. A self-taught sage, he had
no respect for the accredited instructors of Hellas. ‘Much
learning,’ he says, ‘does not teach reason, else it would have
taught Hesiod and Pythagoras, Xenophanes and Hecataeus.’<a id="FNanchor_20_20" href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a>
Homer, he declares, ought to be flogged out of the public
assemblages, and Archilochus likewise. When the highest
reputations met with so little mercy, it will readily be imagined
what contempt he poured on the vulgar herd. The feelings
of a high-born aristocrat combine with those of a lofty genius
to point and wing his words. ‘The many are bad and few
are the good. The best choose one thing instead of all, a
perpetual well-spring of fame, while the many glut their
appetites like beasts. One man is equal to ten thousand if
he is the best.’ This contempt was still further intensified by
the very excusable incapacity of the public to understand
profound thought conveyed in a style proverbial for its
obscurity. ‘Men cannot comprehend the eternal law; when I
have explained the order of Nature they are no wiser than
before.’ What, then, was this eternal law, a knowledge of
which Heracleitus found so difficult to popularise? Let us
look back for a moment at the earlier Ionian systems. They
had taught that the universe arose either by differentiation
or by condensation and expansion from a single primordial
substance, into which, as Anaximander, at least, held, everything,
at last returned. Now, Heracleitus taught that this
transformation is a universal, never-ending, never-resting
process; that all things are moving; that Nature is like a
stream in which no man can bathe twice; that rest and
stability are the law, not of life, but of death. Again, the
Pythagorean school, as we have seen, divided all things into
a series of sharply distinguished antithetical pairs. Heracleitus
either directly identified the terms of every opposition,
or regarded them as necessarily combined, or as continually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
passing into one another. Perhaps we shall express his
meaning most thoroughly by saying that he would have
looked on all three propositions as equivalent statements of a
single fact. In accordance with this principle he calls war
the father and king and lord of all, and denounces Homer’s
prayer for the abolition of strife as an unconscious blasphemy
against the universe itself. Yet, even his powerful intellect
could not grasp the conception of a shifting relativity as the
law and life of things without embodying it in a particular
material substratum. Following the Ionian tradition, he
sought for a world-element, and found it in that cosmic fire
which enveloped the terrestrial atmosphere, and of which the
heavenly luminaries were supposed to be formed. ‘Fire,’
says the Ephesian philosopher, no doubt adapting his language
to the comprehension of a great commercial community, ‘is
the general medium of exchange, as gold is given for everything,
and everything for gold.’ ‘The world was not created
by any god or any man, but always was, and is, and shall be,
an ever-living fire, periodically kindled and quenched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>.‘ By
cooling and condensation, water is formed from fire, and
earth from water; then, by a converse process called the way
up as the other was the way down, earth again passes into
water and water into fire. At the end of certain stated
periods the whole world is to be reconverted into fire, but only
to enter on a new cycle in the series of its endless revolutions—a
conception, so far, remarkably confirmed by modern
science. The whole theory, including a future world conflagration,
was afterwards adopted by the Stoics, and probably
exercised a considerable influence on the eschatology of the
early Christian Church. Imagination is obliged to work
under forms which thought has already superseded; and
Heracleitus as a philosopher had forestalled the dazzling consummation
to which as a prophet he might look forward in
wonder and hope. For, his elemental fire was only a picturesque
presentation indispensable to him, but not to us, of the
sovereign law wherein all things live and move and have their
being. To have introduced such an idea into speculation was
his distinctive and inestimable achievement, although it may
have been suggested by the εἱμαρμένη or destiny of the
theological poets, a term occasionally employed in his
writings. It had a moral as well as a physical meaning, or
rather it hovers ambiguously between the two. ‘The sun
shall not transgress his bounds, or the Erinyes who help
justice will find him out.’ It is the source of human laws,
the common reason which binds men together, therefore they
should hold by it even more firmly than by the laws of the
State. It is not only all-wise but all-good, even where it
seems to be the reverse; for our distinctions between good
and evil, just and unjust, vanish in the divine harmony of
Nature, the concurrent energies and identifying transformations
of her universal life.</p>

<p>According to Aristotle, the Heracleitean flux was inconsistent
with the highest law of thought, and made all predication
impossible. It has been shown that the master himself
recognised a fixed recurring order of change which could be
affirmed if nothing else could. But the principle of change,
once admitted, seemed to act like a corrosive solvent, too
powerful for any vessel to contain. Disciples were soon
found who pushed it to extreme consequences with the effect
of abolishing all certainty whatever. In Plato’s time it was
impossible to argue with a Heracleitean; he could never be
tied down to a definite statement. Every proposition became
false as soon as it was uttered, or rather before it was out of
the speaker’s mouth. At last, a distinguished teacher of the
school declined to commit himself by using words, and disputed
exclusively in dumb show. A dangerous speculative
crisis had set in. At either extremity of the Hellenic world
the path of scientific inquiry was barred; on the one hand by
a theory eliminating non-existence from thought, and on the
other hand by a theory identifying it with existence. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
luminous beam of reflection had been polarised into two
divergent rays, each light where the other was dark and dark
where the other was light, each denying what the other
asserted and asserting what the other denied. For a century
physical speculation had taught that the universe was formed
by the modification of a single eternal substance, whatever
that substance might be. By the end of that period, all
becoming was absorbed into being at Elea, and all being into
becoming at Ephesus. Each view contained a portion of the
truth, and one which perhaps would never have been clearly
perceived if it had not been brought into exclusive prominence.
But further progress was impossible until the two
half-truths had been recombined. We may compare Parmenides
and Heracleitus to two lofty and precipitous peaks
on either side of an Alpine pass. Each commands a wide
prospect, interrupted only on the side of its opposite neighbour.
And the fertilising stream of European thought originates
with neither of them singly, but has its source midway
between.</p>


<h3><a id="I-IV"></a>IV.</h3>

<p>We now enter on the last period of purely objective
philosophy, an age of mediating and reconciling, but still
profoundly original speculation. Its principal representatives,
with whom alone we have to deal, are Empedocles, the
Atomists, Leucippus and Democritus, and Anaxagoras.
There is considerable doubt and difficulty respecting the
order in which they should be placed. Anaxagoras was
unquestionably the oldest and Democritus the youngest of the
four, the difference between their ages being forty years. It
is also nearly certain that the Atomists came after Empedocles.
But if we take a celebrated expression of Aristotle’s<a id="FNanchor_21_21" href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>
literally (as there is no reason why it should not be taken),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
Anaxagoras, although born before Empedocles, published his
views at a later period. Was he also anticipated by Leucippus?
We cannot tell with certainty, but it seems likely
from a comparison of their doctrines that he was; and in all
cases the man who naturalised philosophy in Athens, and
who by his theory of a creative reason furnishes a transition to
the age of subjective speculation, will be most conveniently
placed at the close of the pre-Socratic period.</p>

<p>A splendid tribute has been paid to the fame of Empedocles
by Lucretius, the greatest didactic poet of all time, and
by a great didactic poet of our own time, Mr. Matthew
Arnold. But the still more rapturous panegyric pronounced
by the Roman enthusiast on Epicurus makes his testimony a
little suspicious, and the lofty chant of our own contemporary
must be taken rather as an expression of his own youthful
opinions respecting man’s place in Nature, than as a faithful
exposition of the Sicilian thinker’s creed. Many another
name from the history of philosophy might with better reason
have been prefixed to that confession of resigned and scornful
scepticism entitled <cite>Empedocles on Etna</cite>. The real doctrines
of an essentially religious teacher would hardly have been so
cordially endorsed by Mr. Swinburne. But perhaps no other
character could have excited the deep sympathy felt by one
poetic genius for another, when with both of them thought is
habitually steeped in emotion. Empedocles was the last
Greek of any note who threw his philosophy into a metrical
form. Neither Xenophanes nor Parmenides had done this
with so much success. No less a critic than Aristotle extols
the Homeric splendour of his verses, and Lucretius, in this
respect an authority, speaks of them as almost divine. But,
judging from the fragments still extant, their speculative
content exhibits a distinct decline from the height reached
by his immediate predecessors. Empedocles betrays a distrust
in man’s power of discovering truth, almost, although
not quite, unknown to them. Too much certainty would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
impious. He calls on the ‘much-wooed white-armed virgin
muse’ to—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">‘Guide from the seat of Reverence thy bright car,</div>
  <div class="verse">And bring to us the creatures of a day,</div>
  <div class="verse">What without sin we may aspire to know.’<a id="FNanchor_22_22" href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>We also miss in him their single-minded devotion to philosophy
and their rigorous unity of doctrine. The Acragantine
sage was a party leader (in which capacity, to his great
credit, he victoriously upheld the popular cause), a rhetorician,
an engineer, a physician, and a thaumaturgist. The well-known
legend relating to his death may be taken as a not undeserved
satire on the colossal self-conceit of the man who
claimed divine honours during his lifetime. Half-mystic and
half-rationalist, he made no attempt to reconcile the two inconsistent
sides of his intellectual character. It may be
compared to one of those grotesque combinations in which,
according to his morphology, the heads and bodies of widely
different animals were united during the beginnings of life
before they had learned to fall into their proper places. He
believed in metempsychosis, and professed to remember the
somewhat miscellaneous series of forms through which his
own personality had already run. He had been a boy, a girl,
a bush, a bird, and a fish. Nevertheless, as we shall presently
see, his theory of Nature altogether excluded such a notion
as the soul’s separate existence. We have now to consider
what that theory actually was. It will be remembered that
Parmenides had affirmed the perpetuity and eternal self-identity
of being, but that he had deprived this profound
divination of all practical value by interpreting it in a sense
which excluded diversity and change. Empedocles also
declares creation and destruction to be impossible, but
explains that the appearances so denominated arise from the
union and separation of four everlasting substances—earth,
air, fire, and water. This is the famous doctrine of the four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
elements, which, adopted by Plato and Aristotle, was long
regarded as the last word of chemistry, and still survives in
popular phraseology. Its author may have been guided by
an unconscious reflection on the character of his own
philosophical method, for was not he, too, constructing a new
system out of the elements supplied by his predecessors?
They had successively fixed on water, air, and fire as the
primordial form of existence; he added a fourth, earth, and
effected a sort of reconciliation by placing them all on an
equal footing. Curiously enough, the earlier monistic system
had a relative justification which his crude eclecticism
lacked. All matter may exist either in a solid, a liquid, or a
gaseous form; and all solid matter has reached its present
condition after passing through the two other degrees of
consistency. That the three modifications should be found coexisting
in our own experience is a mere accident of the present
régime, and to enumerate them is to substitute a description
for an explanation, the usual fault of eclectic systems. Empedocles,
however, besides his happy improvement on Parmenides,
made a real contribution to thought when, as Aristotle
puts it, he sought for a moving as well as for a material cause;
in other words, when he asked not only of what elements
the world is composed, but also by what forces were they
brought together. He tells us of two such causes, Love and
Strife, the one a combining, the other a dissociating power.
If for these half-mythological names we read attractive and
repulsive forces, the result will not be very different from our
own current cosmologies. Such terms, when so used as to
assume the existence of occult qualities in matter, driving its
parts asunder or drawing them close together, are, in truth,
as completely mythological as any figments of Hellenic fancy.
Unlike their modern antitypes, the Empedoclean goddesses
did not reign together, but succeeded one another in alternate
dominion during protracted periods of time. The victory of
Love was complete when all things had been drawn into a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
perfect sphere, evidently the absolute Eleatic Being subjected
to a Heracleitean law of vicissitude and contradiction. For
Strife lays hold on the consolidated orb, and by her disintegrating
action gradually reduces it to a formless chaos, till, at
the close of another world-period, the work of creation begins
again. Yet growth and decay are so inextricably intertwined
that Empedocles failed to keep up this ideal separation, and
was compelled to admit the simultaneous activity of both
powers in our everyday experience, so that Nature turns out
to be composed of six elements instead of four, the mind
which perceives it being constituted in a precisely similar
manner. But Love, although on the whole victorious, can
only gradually get the better of her retreating enemy, and
Nature, as we know it, is the result of their continued conflict.
Empedocles described the process of evolution, as he conceived
it, in somewhat minute detail. Two points only are of
much interest to us, his alleged anticipation of the Darwinian
theory and his psychology. The former, such as it
was, has occasionally been attributed to Lucretius, but the
Roman poet most probably copied Epicurus, although the
very brief summary of that philosopher’s physical system
preserved by Diogenes Laertius contains no allusion to such
a topic. We know, however, that in Aristotle’s time a theory
identical with that of Lucretius was held by those who
rejected teleological explanations of the world in general
and of living organisms in particular. All sorts of animals
were produced by spontaneous generation; only those survived
which were accidentally furnished with appliances for
procuring nourishment and for propagating their kind. The
notion itself originated with Empedocles, whose fanciful
suppositions have already been mentioned in a different
connexion. Most assuredly he did not offer it as a solution
of problems which in his time had not yet been mooted, but
as an illustration of the confusion which prevailed when Love
had only advanced a little way in her ordering, harmonising,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
unifying task. Prantl, writing a few years before the appearance
of Mr. Darwin’s book on the Origin of Species, and
therefore without any prejudice on the subject, observes with
truth that this theory of Empedocles was deeply rooted in
the mythological conceptions of the time.<a id="FNanchor_23_23" href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> Perhaps he was
seeking for a rationalistic explanation of the centaurs, minotaurs,
hundred-handed giants, and so forth, in whose existence
he had not, like Lucretius, learned completely to disbelieve.
His strange supposition was afterwards freed from its worst
extravagances; but even as stated in the <cite>De Rerum Naturâ</cite>,
it has no claim whatever to rank as a serious hypothesis.
Anything more unlike the Darwinian doctrine, according to
which all existing species have been evolved from less
highly-organized ancestors by the gradual accumulation of minute
differences, it would be difficult to conceive. Every thinker
of antiquity, with one exception, believed in the immutability
of natural species. They had existed unchanged from all
eternity, or had sprung up by spontaneous generation from
the earth’s bosom in their present form. The solitary dissentient
was Anaximander, who conjectured that man was
descended from an aquatic animal.<a id="FNanchor_24_24" href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> Strange to say, this
lucky guess has not yet been quoted as an argument against
the Ascidian pedigree. It is chiefly the enemies of Darwinism
who are eager to find it anticipated in Empedocles or
Lucretius. By a curious inversion of traditionalism, it is
fancied that a modern discovery can be upset by showing
that somebody said something of the kind more than two
thousand years ago. Unfortunately authority has not the
negative value of disproving the principles which it supports.
We must be content to accept the truths brought to light by
observation and reasoning, even at the risk of finding ourselves
in humiliating agreement with a philosopher of
antiquity.<a id="FNanchor_25_25" href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span></p>

<p>Passing from life to mind, we find Empedocles teaching
an even more pronounced materialism than Parmenides,
inasmuch as it is stated in language of superior precision. Our
souls are, according to him, made up of elements like those
which constitute the external world, each of these being
perceived by a corresponding portion of the same substances
within ourselves—fire by fire, water by water, and so on with
the rest. It is a mistake to suppose that speculation begins
from a subjective standpoint, that men start with a clear
consciousness of their own personality, and proceed to
construct an objective universe after the same pattern.
Doubtless they are too prone to personify the blind forces of
Nature, and Empedocles himself has just supplied us with an
example of this tendency, but they err still more by reading
outward experience into their own souls, by materialising the
processes of consciousness, and resolving human personality
into a loose confederacy of inorganic units. Even Plato, who
did more than anyone else towards distinguishing between
mind and body, ended by laying down his psychology on the
lines of an astronomical system. Meanwhile, to have separated
the perception of an object from the object itself, in
ever so slight a degree, was an important gain to thought.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
We must not omit to notice a hypothesis by which Empedocles
sought to elucidate the mechanism of sensation, and
which was subsequently adopted by the atomic school;
indeed, as will presently be shown, we have reason to believe
that the whole atomic theory was developed out of it. He
held that emanations were being continually thrown off from
the surfaces of bodies, and that they penetrated into the
organs of sense through fine passages or pores. This may
seem a crude guess, but it is at any rate much more scientific
than Aristotle’s explanation. According to the latter, possibilities
of feeling are converted into actualities by the presence
of an object. In other words, we feel when and because
we do; a safe assertion, but hardly an addition to our positive
knowledge of the subject.</p>

<p>We have seen how Greek thought had arrived at a perfectly
just conception of the process by which all physical
transformations are effected. The whole extended universe
is an aggregate of bodies, while each single body is formed
by a combination of everlasting elements, and is destroyed
by their separation. But if Empedocles was right, if these
primary substances were no other than the fire, air, water,
and earth of everyday experience, what became of the
Heracleitean law, confirmed by common observation, that, so
far from remaining unaltered, they were continually passing
into one another? To this question the atomic theory gave
an answer so conclusive, that, although ignored or contemned
by later schools, it was revived with the great revival of
science in the sixteenth century, was successfully employed
in the explanation of every order of phenomena, and still
remains the basis of all physical enquiry. The undulatory
theory of light, the law of universal gravitation, and the
laws of chemical combination can only be expressed in
terms implying the existence of atoms; the laws of
gaseous diffusion, and of thermodynamics generally, can only
be understood with their help; and the latest develop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>ments
of chemistry have tended still further to establish
their reality, as well as to elucidate their remarkable properties.
In the absence of sufficient information, it is difficult
to determine by what steps this admirable hypothesis was
evolved. Yet, even without external evidence, we may fairly
conjecture that, sooner or later, some philosopher, possessed
of a high generalising faculty, would infer that if bodies are
continually throwing off a flux of infinitesimal particles from
their surfaces, they must be similarly subdivided all through;
and that if the organs of sense are honeycombed with imperceptible
pores, such may also be the universal constitution of
matter.<a id="FNanchor_26_26" href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> Now, according to Aristotle, Leucippus, the founder
of atomism, did actually use the second of these arguments,
and employed it in particular to prove the existence of indivisible
solids.<a id="FNanchor_27_27" href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> Other considerations equally obvious suggested
themselves from another quarter. If all change was
expressible in terms of matter and motion, then gradual
change implied interstitial motion, which again involved the
necessity of fine pores to serve as channels for the incoming
and outgoing molecular streams. Nor, as was supposed,
could motion of any kind be conceived without a vacuum, the
second great postulate of the atomic theory. Here its
advocates directly joined issue with Parmenides. The chief
of the Eleatic school had, as we have seen, presented being
under the form of a homogeneous sphere, absolutely continuous
but limited in extent. Space dissociated from matter
was to him, as afterwards to Aristotle, non-existent and impossible.
It was, he exclaimed, inconceivable, nonsensical.
Unhappily inconceivability is about the worst negative
criterion of truth ever yet invented. His challenge was now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
taken up by the Atomists, who boldly affirmed that if non-being
meant empty space, it was just as conceivable and just
as necessary as being. A further stimulus may have been
received from the Pythagorean school, whose doctrines had,
just at this time, been systematised and committed to writing
by Philolaus, its most eminent disciple. The hard saying that
all things were made out of number might be explained and
confirmed if the integers were interpreted as material atoms.</p>

<p>It will have been observed that, so far, the merit of
originating atomism has been attributed to Leucippus, instead
of to the more celebrated Democritus, with whose name it is
usually associated. The two were fast friends, and seem always
to have worked together in perfect harmony. But Leucippus,
although next to nothing is known of his life, was apparently
the older man, and from him, so far as we can make out,
emanated the great idea, which his brilliant coadjutor carried
into every department of enquiry, and set forth in works
which are a loss to literature as well as to science, for the
poetic splendour of their style was not less remarkable than
the encyclopaedic range of their contents. Democritus was
born at Abdêra, a Thracian city, 470 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, a year before
Socrates, and lived to a very advanced age—more than a
hundred, according to some accounts. However this may be,
he was probably, like most of his great countrymen, possessed
of immense vitality. His early manhood was spent in
Eastern travel, and he was not a little proud of the
numerous countries which he had visited, and the learned
men with whom he had conversed. His time was mostly
occupied in observing Nature, and in studying mathematics;
the sages of Asia and Egypt may have acquainted him with
many useful scientific facts, but we have seen that his philosophy
was derived from purely Hellenic sources. A few
fragments of his numerous writings still survive—the relics
of an intellectual Ozymandias. In them are briefly shadowed
forth the conceptions which Lucretius, or at least his modern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
English interpreters, have made familiar to all educated men
and women. Everything is the result of mechanical causation.
Infinite worlds are formed by the collision of infinite
atoms falling for ever downward through infinite space. No
place is left for supernatural agency; nor are the unaided
operations of Nature disguised under Olympian appellations.
Democritus goes even further than Epicurus in his rejection
of the popular mythology. His system provides no interstellar
refuge for abdicated gods. He attributed a kind of
objective existence to the apparitions seen in sleep, and even
a considerable influence for good or for evil, but denied that
they were immortal. The old belief in a Divine Power had
arisen from their activity and from meteorological phenomena
of an alarming kind, but was destitute of any stronger foundation.
For his own part, he looked on the fiery spherical
atoms as a universal reason or soul of the world, without,
however, assigning to them the distinct and commanding
position occupied by a somewhat analogous principle in
the system which we now proceed to examine, and with
which our survey of early Greek thought will most fitly
terminate.</p>


<h3><a id="I-V"></a>V.</h3>

<p>Reasons have already been suggested for placing Anaxagoras
last in order among the physical philosophers, notwithstanding
his priority in point of age to more than one of them.
He was born, according to the most credible accounts, 500 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>,
at Clazomenae, an Ionian city, and settled in Athens when
twenty years of age. There he spent much the greater part
of a long life, illustrating the type of character which
Euripides—expressly referring, as is supposed, to the Ionian
sage—has described in the following choric lines:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span></p><div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">‘Happy is he who has learned</div>
  <div class="verse">To search out the secret of things,</div>
  <div class="verse">Not to the townsmen’s bane,</div>
  <div class="verse">Neither for aught that brings</div>
  <div class="verse">An unrighteous gain.</div>
  <div class="verse">But the ageless order he sees</div>
  <div class="verse">Of nature that cannot die,</div>
  <div class="verse">And the causes whence it springs,</div>
  <div class="verse">And the how and the why.</div>
  <div class="verse">Never have thoughts like these</div>
  <div class="verse">To a deed of dishonour been turned.’<a id="FNanchor_28_28" href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The dishonour was for the townsmen who, in an outbreak of
insane fanaticism, drove the blameless truthseeker from his
adopted home. Anaxagoras was the intimate companion
of Pericles, and Pericles had made many enemies by his
domestic as well as by his foreign policy. A coalition of
harassed interests and offended prejudices was formed against
him. A cry arose that religion and the constitution were in
danger. The Athenians had too much good sense to dismiss
their great democratic Minister, but they permitted the illustrious
statesman’s political opponents to strike at him through
his friends.<a id="FNanchor_29_29" href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> Aspasia was saved only by the tears of her lover.
Pheidias, the grandest, most spiritual-minded artist of all time,
was arrested on a charge of impiety, and died in a prison of
the city whose temples were adorned with the imperishable
monuments of his religious inspiration. A decree against
‘astronomers and atheists’ was so evidently aimed at Anaxagoras
that the philosopher retired to Lampsacus, where he
died at the age of seventy-two, universally admired and
revered. Altars dedicated to Reason and Truth were erected
in his honour, and for centuries his memory continued to
be celebrated by an annual feast.<a id="FNanchor_30_30" href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> His whole existence had
been devoted to science. When asked what made life worth
living, he answered, ‘The contemplation of the heavens and
of the universal cosmic order.’ The reply was like a title-page
to his works. We can see that specialisation was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
beginning, that the positive sciences were separating themselves
from general theories about Nature, and could be
cultivated independently of them. A single individual
might, indeed, combine philosophy of the most comprehensive
kind with a detailed enquiry into some particular order
of phenomena, but he could do this without bringing the two
studies into any immediate connexion with each other.
Such seems to have been the case with Anaxagoras. He
was a professional astronomer and also the author of a
modified atomic hypothesis. This, from its greater complexity,
seems more likely to have been suggested by the
purely quantitative conception of Leucippus than to have
preceded it in the order of evolution. Democritus, and
probably his teacher also, drew a very sharp distinction
between what were afterwards called the primary and
secondary qualities of matter. Extension and resistance
alone had a real existence in Nature, while the attributes
corresponding to our special sensations, such as temperature,
taste, and colour, were only subjectively, or, as he expressed
it, conventionally true. Anaxagoras affirmed no less strongly
than his younger contemporaries that the sum of being can
neither be increased nor diminished, that all things arise and
perish by combination and division, and that bodies are
formed out of indestructible elements; like the Atomists,
again, he regarded these elementary substances as infinite
in number and inconceivably minute; only he considered
them as qualitatively distinct, and as resembling on an
infinitesimal scale the highest compounds that they build up.
Not only were gold, iron, and the other metals formed of
homogeneous particles, but such substances as flesh, bone, and
blood were, according to him, equally simple, equally decomposable,
into molecules of like nature with themselves.
Thus, as Aristotle well observes, he reversed the method of
Empedocles, and taught that earth, air, fire, and water were
really the most complex of all bodies, since they supplied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
nourishment to the living tissues, and therefore must contain
within themselves the multitudinous variety of units by whose
aggregation individualised organic substance is made up.<a id="FNanchor_31_31" href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a>
Furthermore, our philosopher held that originally this intermixture
had been still more thoroughgoing, all possible
qualities being simultaneously present in the smallest particles
of matter. The resulting state of chaotic confusion
lasted until Nous, or Reason, came and segregated the
heterogeneous elements by a process of continuous differentiation
leading up to the present arrangement of things. Both
Plato and Aristotle have commended Anaxagoras for introducing
into speculation the conception of Reason as a
cosmic world-ordering power; both have censured him for
making so little use of his own great thought, for attributing
almost everything to secondary, material, mechanical causes;
for not everywhere applying the teleological method; in fact,
for not anticipating the Bridgewater Treatises and proving
that the world is constructed on a plan of perfect wisdom
and goodness. Less fortunate than the Athenians, we
cannot purchase the work of Anaxagoras on Nature at an
orchestral book-stall for the moderate price of a drachma;
but we know enough about its contents to correct the somewhat
petulant and superficial criticism of a school perhaps
less in sympathy than we are with its author’s method of
research. Evidently the Clazomenian philosopher did not
mean by Reason an ethical force, a power which makes for
human happiness or virtue, nor yet a reflecting intelligence,
a designer adapting means to ends. To all appearances the
Nous was not a spirit in the sense which we attach, or which
Aristotle attached to the term. It was, according to Anaxagoras,
the subtlest and purest of all things, totally unmixed
with other substances, and therefore able to control and
bring them into order. This is not how men speak of an
immaterial inextended consciousness. The truth is that no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
amount of physical science could create, although it might
lead towards a spiritualistic philosophy. Spiritualism first
arose from the sophistic negation of an external world, from
the exclusive study of man, from the Socratic search after
general definitions. Yet, if Nous originally meant intelligence,
how could it lose this primary signification and become
identified with a mere mode of matter? The answer
is, that Anaxagoras, whose whole life was spent in tracing
out the order of Nature, would instinctively think of his own
intelligence as a discriminating, identifying faculty; would,
consequently, conceive its objective counterpart under the
form of a differentiating and integrating power. All preceding
thinkers had represented their supreme being under
material conditions, either as one element singly or as a sum
total where elemental differences were merged. Anaxagoras
differed from them chiefly by the very sharp distinction
drawn between his informing principle and the rest of Nature.
The absolute intermixture of qualities which he presupposes
bears a very strong resemblance both to the Sphairos of
Empedocles and to the fiery consummation of Heracleitus, it
may even have been suggested by them. Only, what with
them was the highest form of existence becomes with him
the lowest; thought is asserting itself more and more, and
interpreting the law of evolution in accordance with its own
imperious demands.</p>

<p>A world where ordering reason was not only raised to
supreme power, but also jealously secluded from all communion
with lower forms of existence, meant to popular imagination
a world from which divinity had been withdrawn.
The astronomical teaching of Anaxagoras was well calculated
to increase a not unfounded alarm. Underlying the
local tribal mythology of Athens and of Greece generally,
was an older, deeper Nature-worship, chiefly directed towards
those heavenly luminaries which shone so graciously on all
men, and to which all men yielded, or were supposed to yield,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
grateful homage in return. <i lang="la">Securus judicat orbis terrarum.</i>
Every Athenian citizen from Nicias to Strepsiades would feel
his own belief strengthened by such a universal concurrence
of authority. Two generations later, Plato held fast to the
same conviction, severely denouncing its impugners, whom he
would, if possible, have silenced with the heaviest penalties.
To Aristotle, also, the heavenly bodies were something far
more precious and perfect than anything in our sublunary
sphere, something to be spoken of only in language of enthusiastic
and passionate love. At a far later period Marcus
Aurelius could refer to them as visible gods;<a id="FNanchor_32_32" href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> and just before
the final extinction of Paganism highly-educated men still
offered up their orisons in silence and secresy to the moon.<a id="FNanchor_33_33" href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a>
Judge, then, with what horror an orthodox public received
Anaxagoras’s announcement that the moon shone only by
reflected light, that she was an earthy body, and that her
surface was intersected with mountains and ravines, besides
being partially built over. The bright Selênê, the Queen of
Heaven, the most interesting and sympathetic of goddesses,
whose phases so vividly recalled the course of human life, who
was firmly believed to bring fine weather at her return and to
take it away at her departure, was degraded into a cold, dark,
senseless clod.<a id="FNanchor_34_34" href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> Democritus observed that all this had been
known a long time in the Eastern countries where he had
travelled.<span class="ref"><a href="#C">C</a></span> Possibly; but fathers of families could not have
been more disturbed if it had been a brand-new discovery.
The sun, too, they were told, was a red-hot stone larger than
Peloponnesus—a somewhat unwieldy size even for a Homeric
god. Socrates, little as he cared about physical investigations
generally, took this theory very seriously to heart, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
attempted to show by a series of distinctions that sun-heat
and fire-heat were essentially different from each other. A
duller people than the Athenians would probably have
shown far less suspicion of scientific innovations. Men who
were accustomed to anticipate the arguments of an orator
before they were half out of his mouth, with whom the extraction
of reluctant admissions by cross-examination was habitually
used as a weapon of attack and defence in the public law
courts and practised as a game in private circles—who were
perpetually on their guard against insidious attacks from
foreign and domestic foes—had minds ready trained to the
work of an inquisitorial priesthood. An Athenian, moreover,
had mythology at his fingers’ ends; he was accustomed to see
its leading incidents placed before him on the stage not only
with intense realism, but with a systematic adaptation to the
demands of common experience and a careful concatenation
of cause and effect, which gave his belief in them all the force
of a rational conviction while retaining all the charm of a
supernatural creed. Then, again, the constitution of Athens,
less than that of any other Greek State, could be worked
without the devoted, self-denying co-operation of her citizens,
and in their minds sense of duty was inseparably associated
with religious belief, based in its turn on mythological traditions.
A great poet has said, and said truly, that Athens was
‘on the will of man as on a mount of diamond set,’ but the
crystallising force which gave that collective human will such
clearness and keenness and tenacity was faith in the protecting
presence of a diviner Will at whose withdrawal it would have
crumbled into dust. Lastly, the Athenians had no genius for
natural science; none of them were ever distinguished as
savants. They looked on the new knowledge much as Swift
looked on it two thousand years afterwards. It was, they
thought, a miserable trifling waste of time, not productive of
any practical good, breeding conceit in young men, and quite
unworthy of receiving any attention from orators, soldiers, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
statesmen. Pericles, indeed, thought differently, but Pericles
was as much beyond his age when he talked about Nature
with Anaxagoras as when he charged Aspasia with the
government of his household and the entertainment of his
guests.</p>

<p>These reflections are offered, not in excuse but in explanation
of Athenian intolerance, a phenomenon for the rest
unparalleled in ancient Greece. We cannot say that men
were then, or ever have been, logically obliged to choose
between atheism and superstition. If instead of using Nous
as a half-contemptuous nickname for the Clazomenian stranger,<span class="ref"><a href="#D">D</a></span>
his contemporaries had taken the trouble to understand what
Nous really meant, they might have found in it the possibility
of a deep religious significance; they might have identified it
with all that was best and purest in their own guardian
goddess Athênê; have recognised it as the very foundation of
their own most characteristic excellences. But vast spiritual
revolutions are not so easily accomplished; and when, before
the lapse of many years, Nous was again presented to the
Athenian people, this time actually personified as an Athenian
citizen, it was again misunderstood, again rejected, and
became the occasion for a display of the same persecuting
spirit, unhappily pushed to a more fatal extreme.</p>

<p>Under such unfavourable auspices did philosophy find a
home in Athens. The great maritime capital had drawn to
itself every other species of intellectual eminence, and this
could not fail to follow with the rest. But philosophy,
although hitherto identified with mathematical and physical
science, held unexhausted possibilities of development in
reserve. According to a well-known legend, Thales once fell
into a tank while absorbed in gazing at the stars. An old
woman advised him to look at the tank in future, for there he
would see the water and the stars as well. Others after him
had got into similar difficulties, and might seek to evade
them by a similar artifice. While busied with the study of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
cosmic evolution, they had stumbled unawares on some perplexing
mental problems. Why do the senses suggest beliefs
so much at variance with those arrived at by abstract reasoning?
Why should reason be more trustworthy than sense?
Why are the foremost Hellenic thinkers so hopelessly disagreed?
What is the criterion of truth? Of what use are
conclusions which cannot command universal assent? Or,
granting that truth is discoverable, how can it be communicated
to others? Such were some of the questions now beginning
urgently to press for a solution. ‘I sought for myself,’
said Heracleitus in his oracular style. His successors had to
do even more—to seek not only for themselves but for others;
to study the beliefs, habits, and aptitudes of their hearers
with profound sagacity, in order to win admission for the
lessons they were striving to impart. And when a systematic
investigation of human nature had once begun, it could not
stop short with a mere analysis of the intellectual faculties;
what a man did was after all so very much more important
than what he knew, was, in truth, that which alone gave his
knowledge any practical value whatever. Moral distinctions,
too, were beginning to grow uncertain. When every other
traditional belief had been shaken to its foundations, when
men were taught to doubt the evidence of their own senses,
it was not to be expected that the conventional laws of
conduct, at no time very exact or consistent, would continue
to be accepted on the authority of ancient usage. Thus, every
kind of determining influences, internal and external, conspired
to divert philosophy from the path which it had hitherto
pursued, and to change it from an objective, theoretical study
into an introspective, dialectic, practical discipline.</p>


<h3><a id="I-VI"></a>VI.</h3>

<p>And now, looking back at the whole course of early Greek
thought, presenting as it does a gradual development and an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
organic unity which prove it to be truly a native growth, a
spontaneous product of the Greek mind, let us take one step
further and enquire whether before the birth of pure speculation,
or parallel with but apart from its rudimentary efforts,
there were not certain tendencies displayed in the other great
departments of intellectual activity, fixed forms as it were in
which the Hellenic genius was compelled to work, which reproduce
themselves in philosophy and determine its distinguishing
characteristics. Although the materials for a complete
Greek ethology are no longer extant, it can be shown
that such tendencies did actually exist.</p>

<p>It is a familiar fact, first brought to light by Lessing, and
generalised by him into a law of all good literary composition,
that Homer always throws his descriptions into a narrative
form. We are not told what a hero wore, but how he put on
his armour; when attention is drawn to a particular object
we are made acquainted with its origin and past history;
even the reliefs on a shield are invested with life and movement.
Homer was not impelled to adopt this method either
by conscious reflection or by a profound poetic instinct. At
a certain stage of intellectual development, every Greek would
find it far easier to arrange the data of experience in successive
than in contemporaneous order; the one is fixed, the other
admits of indefinite variation. Pictorial and plastic art also
begin with serial presentations, and only arrive at the construction
of large centralised groups much later on. We
have next to observe that, while Greek reflection at first
followed the order of time, it turned by preference not to
present or future, but to past time. Nothing in Hellenic
literature reminds us of Hebrew prophecy. To a Greek all
distinct prevision was merged in the gloom of coming death
or the glory of anticipated fame. Of course, at every great
crisis of the national fortunes much curiosity prevailed among
the vulgar as to what course events would take; but it was
sedulously discouraged by the noblest minds. Herodotus and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
Sophocles look on even divine predictions as purposely
ambiguous and misleading. Pindar often dwells on the
hopeless uncertainty of life.<a id="FNanchor_35_35" href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> Thucydides treats all vaticination
as utterly delusive. So, when a belief in the soul’s
separate existence first obtained acceptance among the Greeks,
it interested them far less as a pledge of never-ending life and
progress hereafter, than as involving a possible revelation of
past history, of the wondrous adventures which each individual
had passed through before assuming his present form. Hence
the peculiar force of Pindar’s congratulation to the partaker
in the Eleusinian mysteries; after death he knows not only
‘the end of life,’ but also ‘its god-given beginning.’<a id="FNanchor_36_36" href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> Even
the present was not intelligible until it had been projected
back into the past, or interpreted by the light of some ancient
tale. Sappho, in her famous ode to Aphroditê, recalls the
incidents of a former passion precisely similar to the unrequited
love which now agitates her heart, and describes at
length how the goddess then came to her relief as she is now
implored to come again. Modern critics have spoken of this
curious literary artifice as a sign of delicacy and reserve. We
may be sure that Sappho was an utter stranger to such
feelings; she ran her thoughts into a predetermined mould
just as a bee builds its wax into hexagonal cells. Curtius, the
German historian, has surmised with much plausibility that
the entire legend of Troy owes its origin to this habit of
throwing back contemporary events into a distant past.
According to his view, the characters and scenes recorded by
Homer, although unhistorical as they now stand, had really a
place in the Achaean colonisation of Asia Minor.<a id="FNanchor_37_37" href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> But,
apart from any disguised allusions, old stories had an inexhaustible
charm for the Greek imagination. Even during
the stirring events of the Peloponnesian war, elderly Athenian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
citizens in their hours of relaxation talked of nothing but
mythology.<a id="FNanchor_38_38" href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> When a knowledge of reading became universally
diffused, and books could be had at a moderate price,
ancient legends seem to have been the favourite literature of
the lower classes, just as among ourselves in Caxton’s time.
Still more must the same taste have prevailed a century
earlier. A student who opens Pindar’s epinician odes for the
first time is surprised to find so little about the victorious
combatants and the struggles in which they took part, so
much about mythical adventures seemingly unconnected with
the ostensible subject of the poem. Furthermore, we find
that genealogies were the framework by which these distant
recollections were held together. Most noble families traced
their descent back to a god or to a god-like hero. The entire
interval separating the historical period from the heroic age
was filled up with more or less fictitious pedigrees. A man’s
ancestry was much the most important part of his biography.
It is likely that Herodotus had just as enthusiastic an
admiration as we can have for Leonidas. Yet one fancies
that a historian of later date would have shown his appreciation
of the Spartan king in a rather different fashion. We
should have been told something about the hero’s personal
appearance, and perhaps some characteristic incidents from
his earlier career would have been related. Not so with
Herodotus. He pauses in the story of Thermopylae to give
us the genealogy of Leonidas up to Heraclês; no more and
no less. That was the highest compliment he could pay, and
it is repeated for Pausanias, the victor of Plataea.<a id="FNanchor_39_39" href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> The
genealogical method was capable of wide extension, and
could be applied to other than human or animal relationships.
Hesiod’s Theogony is a genealogy of heaven and earth, and
all that in them is. According to Aeschylus, gain is bred
from gain, slaughter from slaughter, woe from woe. Insolence
bears a child like unto herself, and this in turn gives birth to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
a still more fatal progeny.<a id="FNanchor_40_40" href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> The same poet terminates his
enumeration of the flaming signals that sped the message of
victory from Troy to Argos, by describing the last beacon as
‘not ungrandsired by the Idaean fire.’<a id="FNanchor_41_41" href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> Now, when the Greek
genius had begun to move in any direction, it rushed forward
without pausing until arrested by an impassable limit, and
then turned back to retraverse at leisure the whole interval
separating that limit from its point of departure. Thus, the
ascending lines of ancestry were followed up until they led to
a common father of all; every series of outrages was traced
through successive reprisals back to an initial crime; and
more generally every event was affiliated to a preceding event,
until the whole chain had been attached to an ultimate self-existing
cause. Hence the records of origination, invention,
spontaneity were long sought after with an eagerness which
threw almost every other interest into the shade. ‘Glory be
to the inventor,’ sings Pindar, in his address to victorious
Corinth; ‘whence came the graces of the dithyrambic hymn,
who first set the double eagle on the temples of the gods?’<a id="FNanchor_42_42" href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a>
The <cite>Prometheus</cite> of Aeschylus tells how civilisation began,
and the trilogy to which it belongs was probably intended to
show how the supremacy of Zeus was first established and
secured. A great part of the <cite>Agamemnon</cite> deals with events
long anterior to the opening of the drama, but connected as
ultimate causes with the terrible catastrophe which it represents.
In the <cite>Eumenides</cite> we see how the family, as it now
exists, was first constituted by the substitution of paternal for
maternal headship, and also how the worship of the Avenging
Goddesses was first introduced into Athens, as well as how
the Areopagite tribunal was founded. It is very probable
that Sophocles’s earliest work, the <cite>Triptolemus</cite>, represented
the origin of agriculture under a dramatic form; and if the
same poet’s later pieces, as well as all those of Euripides,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
stand on quite different ground, occupied as they are with
subjects of contemporaneous, or rather of eternal interest, we
must regard this as a proof that the whole current of Greek
thought had taken a new direction, corresponding to that
simultaneously impressed on philosophy by Socrates and the
Sophists. We may note further that the Aeginetan sculptures,
executed soon after Salamis, though evidently intended
to commemorate that victory, represent a conflict waged long
before by the tutelary heroes of Aegina against an Asiatic
foe. We may also see in our own British Museum how the
birth of Athênê was recorded in a marble group on one pediment
of the Parthenon, and the foundation of her chosen city
on the other. The very temple which these majestic sculptures
once adorned was a petrified memorial of antiquity, and, by
the mere form of its architecture, must have carried back men’s
thoughts to the earliest Hellenic habitation, the simple structure
in which a gabled roof was supported by cross-beams on
a row of upright wooden posts.</p>

<p>Turning back once more from art and literature to philosophy,
is it not abundantly clear that if the Greeks speculated
at all, they must at first have speculated according
to some such method as that which history proves them
to have actually followed? They must have begun by
fixing their thoughts, as Thales and his successors did, on the
world’s remotest past; they must have sought for a first
cause of things, and conceived it, not as any spiritual power,
but as a kind of natural ancestor homogeneous with the forms
which issued from it, although greater and more comprehensive
than they were; in short, as an elemental body—water, air,
fire, or, more vaguely, as an infinite substance. Did not the
steady concatenation of cause and effect resemble the unrolling
of a heroic genealogy? And did not the reabsorption
of every individual existence in a larger whole translate into
more general terms that subordination of personal to family
and civic glory which is the diapason of Pindar’s music?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span></p>

<p>Nor was this all. Before philosophising, the Greeks did
not think only in the order of time; they learned at a very
early period to think also in the order of space, their favourite
idea of a limit being made especially prominent here.
Homer’s geographical notions, however erroneous, are, for his
age, singularly well defined. Aeschylus has a wide knowledge
of the earth’s surface, and exhibits it with perhaps
unnecessary readiness. Pindar delights to follow his mythological
heroes about on their travels. The same tendency
found still freer scope when prose literature began. Hecataeus,
one of the earliest prose-writers, was great both as a
genealogist and as a geographer; and in this respect also
Herodotus carried out on a great scale the enquiries most
habitually pursued by his countrymen. Now, it will be
remembered that we have had occasion to characterise early
Ionian speculation as being, to a great extent, cosmography.
The element from which it deduced all things was, in fact,
that which was supposed to lie outside and embrace the rest.
The geographical limit was conceived as a genealogical
ancestor. Thus, the studies which men like Hecataeus carried
on separately, were combined, or rather confused, in a single
bold generalisation by Anaximenes and Heracleitus.</p>

<p>Yet, however much may be accounted for by these considerations,
they still leave something unexplained. Why
should one thinker after another so unhesitatingly assume
that the order of Nature as we know it has issued not merely
from a different but from an exactly opposite condition, from
universal confusion and chaos? Their experience was far
too limited to tell them anything about those vast cosmic
changes which we know by incontrovertible evidence to have
already occurred, and to be again in course of preparation.
We can only answer this question by bringing into view
what may be called the negative moment of Greek thought.
The science of contraries is one, says Aristotle, and it certainly
was so to his countrymen. Not only did they delight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
to bring together the extremes of weal and woe, of pride and
abasement, of security and disaster, but whatever they most
loved and clung to in reality seemed to interest their imagination
most powerfully by its removal, its reversal, or its overthrow.
The Athenians were peculiarly intolerant of regal
government and of feminine interference in politics. In
Athenian tragedy the principal actors are kings and royal
ladies. The Athenian matrons occupied a position of exceptional
dignity and seclusion. They are brought upon
the comic stage to be covered with the coarsest ridicule, and
also to interfere decisively in the conduct of public affairs.
Aristophanes was profoundly religious himself, and wrote for
a people whose religion, as we have seen, was pushed to
the extreme of bigotry. Yet he shows as little respect for
the gods as for the wives and sisters of his audience. To
take a more general example still, the whole Greek tragic
drama is based on the idea of family kinship, and that institution
was made most interesting to Greek spectators by the
violation of its eternal sanctities, by unnatural hatred, and
still more unnatural love; or by a fatal misconception which
causes the hands of innocent persons, more especially of
tender women, to be armed against their nearest and dearest
relatives in utter unconsciousness of the awful guilt about to
be incurred. By an extension of the same psychological law
to abstract speculation we are enabled to understand how an
early Greek philosopher who had come to look on Nature as
a cosmos, an orderly whole, consisting of diverse but connected
and interdependent parts, could not properly grasp
such a conception until he had substituted for it one of
a precisely opposite character, out of which he reconstructed
it by a process of gradual evolution. And if
it is asked how in the first place did he come by the
idea of a cosmos, our answer must be that he found it in
Greek life, in societies distinguished by a many-sided but
harmonious development of concurrent functions, and by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
voluntary obedience to an impersonal law. Thus, then, the
circle is complete; we have returned to our point of departure,
and again recognise in Greek philosophy a systematised
expression of the Greek national genius.</p>

<p>We must now bring this long and complicated, but it is
hoped not uninteresting, study to a close. We have accompanied
philosophy to a point where it enters on a new field,
and embraces themes sufficiently important to form the
subject of a separate chapter. The contributions made by
its first cultivators to our positive knowledge have already
been summarised. It remains to mention that there was
nothing of a truly transcendental character about their speculations.
Whatever extension we may give to that terrible
bugbear, the Unknowable, they did not trespass on its
domain. Heracleitus and his compeers, while penetrating
far beyond the horizon of their age and country, kept very
nearly within the limits of a possible experience. They
confused some conceptions which we have learned to distinguish,
and separated others which we have learned to combine;
but they were the lineal progenitors of our highest scientific
thought; and they first broke ground on a path where we
must continue to advance, if the cosmos which they won for
us is not to be let lapse into chaos and darkness again.</p>

<small>THE GREEK HUMANISTS: NATURE AND LAW.</small></h2>


<h3><a id="II-I"></a>I.</h3>

<p>In the preceding chapter we traced the rise and progress of
physical philosophy among the ancient Greeks. We showed
how a few great thinkers, borne on by an unparalleled development
of intellectual activity, worked out ideas respecting the
order of nature and the constitution of matter which, after
more than two thousand years, still remain as fresh and fruitful
as ever; and we found that, in achieving these results, Greek
thought was itself determined by ascertainable laws. Whether
controlling artistic imagination or penetrating to the objective
truth of things, it remained always essentially homogeneous,
and worked under the same forms of circumscription, analysis,
and opposition. It began with external nature, and with a far
distant past; nor could it begin otherwise, for only so could
the subjects of its later meditations be reached. Only after
less sacred beliefs have been shaken can ethical dogmas be
questioned. Only when discrepancies of opinion obtrude
themselves on man’s notice is the need of an organising logic
experienced. And the mind’s eye, originally focussed for distant
objects alone, has to be gradually restricted in its range
by the pressure of accumulated experience before it can turn
from past to present, from successive to contemporaneous
phenomena. We have now to undertake the not less interesting
task of showing how the new culture, the new conceptions,
the new power to think obtained through those earliest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
speculations, reacted on the life from which they sprang,
transforming the moral, religious, and political creeds of
Hellas, and preparing, as nothing else could prepare, the
vaster revolution which has given a new dignity to existence,
and substituted, in however imperfect a form, for the adoration
of animalisms which lie below man, the adoration of an
ideal which rises above him, but only personifies the best
elements of his own nature, and therefore is possible for a
perfected humanity to realise.</p>

<p>While most educated persons will admit that the Greeks
are our masters in science and literature, in politics and art,
some even among those who are free from theological prejudices
will not be prepared to grant that the principles which
claim to guide our conduct are only a wider extension or a
more specific application of Greek ethical teaching. Hebraism
has been opposed to Hellenism as the educating power whence
our love of righteousness is derived, and which alone prevents
the foul orgies of a primitive nature-worship from being still
celebrated in the midst of our modern civilisation. And
many look on old Roman religion as embodying a sense of
duty higher than any bequeathed to us by Greece. The
Greeks have, indeed, suffered seriously from their own sincerity.
Their literature is a perfect image of their life, reflecting
every blot and every flaw, unveiled, uncoloured, undisguised.
It was, most fortunately, never subjected to the revision of a
jealous priesthood, bent on removing every symptom inconsistent
with the hypothesis of a domination exercised by
themselves through all the past. Nor yet has their history
been systematically falsified to prove that they never wrongfully
attacked a neighbour, and were invariably obliged to
conquer in self-defence. Still, even taking the records as
they stand, it is to Greek rather than to Hebrew or Roman
annals that we must look for examples of true virtue; and in
Greek literature, earlier than in any other, occur precepts like
those which are now held to be most distinctively character<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>istic
of Christian ethics. Let us never forget that only by
Stoical teaching was the narrow and cruel formalism of
ancient Roman law elevated into the ‘written reason’ of the
imperial jurists; only after receiving successive infiltrations
of Greek thought was the ethnic monotheism of Judaea expanded
into a cosmopolitan religion. Our popular theologians
are ready enough to admit that Hellenism was providentially
the means of giving Christianity a world-wide diffusion; they
ignore the fact that it gave the new faith not only wings to
fly, but also eyes to see and a soul to love. From very early
times there was an intuition of humanity in Hellas which only
needed dialectical development to become an all-sufficient
law of life. Homer sympathises ardently with his own
countrymen, but he never vilifies their enemies. He did not,
nor did any Greek, invent impure legends to account for the
origin of hostile tribes whose kinship could not be disowned;
unlike Samuel, he regards the sacrifice of prisoners with unmixed
abhorrence. What would he, whose Odysseus will
not allow a shout of triumph to be raised over the fallen,
have said to Deborah’s exultation at the murder of a
suppliant fugitive? Courage was, indeed, with him the
highest virtue, and Greek literature abounds in martial spirit-stirring
tones, but it is nearly always by the necessities of
self-defence that this enthusiasm is invoked; with Pindar and
Simonides, with Aeschylus and Sophocles, it is resistance to
an invader that we find so proudly commemorated; and the
victories which make Greek history so glorious were won in
fighting to repel an unjust aggression perpetrated either by
the barbarians or by a tyrant state among the Greeks themselves.
There was, as will be shown hereafter, an unhappy
period when right was either denied, or, what comes to the
same thing, identified with might; but this offensive paradox
only served to waken true morality into a more vivid self-consciousness,
and into the felt need of discovering for itself
a stronger foundation than usage and tradition, a loftier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
sanction than mere worldly success could afford. The most
universal principle of justice, to treat others as we should
wish to be treated ourselves, seems before the Rabbi Hillel’s
time to have become almost a common-place of Greek ethics;<a id="FNanchor_43_43" href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a>
difficulties left unsolved by the Book of Job were raised to a
higher level by Greek philosophy; and long before St. Paul,
a Plato reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment
to come.</p>

<p>No one will deny that the life of the Greeks was stained
with foul vices, and that their theory sometimes fell to the
level of their practice. No one who believes that moral
truth, like all truth, has been gradually discovered, will
wonder at this phenomenon. If moral conduct is a function
of social life, then, like other functions, it will be subject, not
only to growth, but also to disease and decay. An intense
and rapid intellectual development may have for its condition
a totally abnormal state of society, where certain vices,
unknown to ruder ages, spring up and flourish with rank
luxuriance. When men have to take women along with them
on every new path of enquiry, progress will be considerably
retarded, although its benefits will ultimately be shared
among a greater number, and will be better insured against
the danger of a violent reaction. But the work that Hellas
was commissioned to perform could not wait; it had to be
accomplished in a few generations, or not at all. The
barbarians were forcing their way in on every side, not
merely with the weight of invading armies, but with the
deadlier pressure of a benumbing superstition, with the brute-worship
of Egypt and the devil-worship of Phoenicia, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
their delirious orgies, their mutilations, their crucifixions, and
their gladiatorial contests. Already in the later dramas of
Euripides and in the Rhodian school of sculpture, we see the
awful shadow coming nearer, and feel the poisonous breath
of Asia on our faces. Reason, the reason by which these
terrors have been for ever exorcised, could only arrive at
maturity under the influence of free and uninterrupted
discussion carried on by men among themselves in the
gymnasium, the agora, the ecclêsia, and the dicastery. The
resulting and inevitable separation of the sexes bred frightful
disorders, which through all changes of creed have clung
like a moral pestilence to the shores of the Aegean, and have
helped to complicate political problems by joining to
religious hatred the fiercer animosity of physical disgust.
But whatever were the corruptions of Greek sentiment,
Greek philosophy had the power to purge them away.
‘Follow nature’ became the watchword of one school after
another; and a precept which at first may have meant only
that man should not fall below the brutes, was finally so
interpreted as to imply an absolute control of sense by
reason. No loftier standard of sexual purity has ever been
inculcated than that fixed by Plato in his latest work, the
<cite>Laws</cite>. Isocrates bids husbands set an example of conjugal
fidelity to their wives. Socrates had already declared that
virtue was the same for both sexes. Xenophon interests
himself in the education of women. Plato would give them
the same training, and everywhere associate them in the
same functions with men. Equally decisive evidence of a
theoretical opposition to slavery is not forthcoming, and we
know that it was unfortunately sanctioned by Plato and
Aristotle, in this respect no better inspired than the early
Christians; nevertheless, the germ of such an opposition
existed, and will hereafter be pointed out.</p>

<p>It has been said that the Greeks only worshipped beauty;
that they cultivated morality from the aesthetic side; that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
virtue was with them a question, not of duty, but of taste.
Some very strong texts might be quoted in support of this
judgment. For example, we find Isocrates saying, in his
encomium on Helen, that ‘Beauty is the first of all things in
majesty, and honour, and divineness. It is easy to see its
power: there are many things which have no share of
courage, or wisdom, or justice, which yet will be found honoured
above things which have each of these, but nothing which is
devoid of beauty is prized; all things are scorned which have
not been given their part of that attribute; the admiration
for virtue itself comes to this, that of all manifestations of life
virtue is the most <em>beautiful</em>.’<a id="FNanchor_44_44" href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> And Aristotle distinguishes
the highest courage as willingness to die for the καλόν. So
also Plato describes philosophy as a love ‘that leads one
from fair forms to fair practices, and from fair practices to
fair notions, until from fair notions he arrives at the notion of
absolute beauty, and at last knows what the essence of beauty
is. And this is that life beyond all others which man should
live in the contemplation of beauty absolute.’<a id="FNanchor_45_45" href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> Now, first of
all, we must observe that, while loveliness has been worshipped
by many others, none have conceived it under a form so
worthy of worship as the Greeks. Beauty with them was
neither little, nor fragile, nor voluptuous; the soul’s energies
were not relaxed but exalted by its contemplation; there
was in it an element of austere and commanding dignity.
The Argive Hêrê, though revealed to us only through a softened
Italian copy, has more divinity in her countenance than
any Madonna of them all; and the Melian Aphroditê is distinguished
by majesty of form not less than by purity and
sweetness of expression. This beauty was the unreserved information
of matter by mind, the visible rendering of absolute
power, wisdom, and goodness. Therefore, what a Greek wor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>shipped
was the perpetual and ever-present energising of mind;
but he forgot that beauty can only exist as a combination of
spirit with sense; and, after detaching the higher element, he
continued to call it by names and clothe it in attributes proper
to its earthly manifestations alone. Yet such an extension of
the aesthetic sentiment involved no weakening of the moral
fibre. A service comprehending all idealisms in one demanded
the self-effacement of a laborious preparation and the self-restraint
of a gradual achievement. They who pitched the
goal of their aspiration so high, knew that the paths leading
up to it were rough, and steep, and long; they felt that perfect
workmanship and perfect taste, being supremely precious,
must be supremely difficult as well; χαλεπὰ τὰ καλά they
said, the beautiful is hard—hard to judge, hard to win, and
hard to keep. He who has passed through that stern discipline
need tremble at no other task; nor has duty anything to
fear from a companionship whose ultimate requirements are
coincident with her own, and the abandonment of which for a
joyless asceticism can only lead to the reappearance as an
invading army of forces that should have been cherished as
indispensable allies.</p>

<p>It may be urged that beauty, however difficult of attainment
or severe in form, is, after all, essentially superficial;
and that a morality elaborated on the same principles will be
equally superficial—will, in fact, be little more than the art of
keeping up appearances, of displaying fine sentiments, of
avoiding those actions the consequences of which are immediately
felt to be disagreeable, and, above all, of not needlessly
wounding anyone’s sensibilities. Such an imitation of morality—which
it would be a mistake to call hypocrisy—has no
doubt been common enough among all civilised nations; but
there is no reason to believe that it was in any way favoured
by the circumstances of Greek life. There is even evidence of
a contrary tendency, as, indeed, might be expected among a
people whose most important states were saved from the corrupt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>ing
influences of a court. Where the sympathetic admiration
of shallow and excitable spectators is the effect chiefly sought
after, the showy virtues will be preferred to the solid, and the
appearance to the reality of all virtue; while brilliant and
popular qualities will be allowed to atone for the most atrocious
crimes. But, among the Greeks of the best period,
courage and generosity rank distinctly lower than temperance
and justice; their poets and moralists alike inculcate the preference
of substance to show; and in no single instance, so
far as we can judge, did they, as modern nations often do, for
the sake of great achievements condone great wrongs. It was
said of a Greek and by a Greek that he did not wish to seem
but to be just.<a id="FNanchor_46_46" href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> We follow the judgment of the Greeks
themselves in preferring Leonidas to Pausanias, Aristeides to
Themistocles, and Socrates to Alcibiades. And we need
only compare Epameinondas with David or Pericles with
Solomon as national heroes, to perceive at once how much
nearer the two Greeks come to our own standard of perfection,
and how futile are the charges sometimes brought against
those from whose traditions we have inherited their august
and stainless fame.</p>

<p>Moreover, we have not here to consider what was the
average level of sentiment and practice among the Greeks;
we have to study what alone was of importance for the races
which came under their tuition, and that is the highest moral
judgment to which they rose. Now, the deliberate verdict of
their philosophy on the relation between beauty and virtue is
contained in the following passage from Plato’s <cite>Laws</cite>:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘When anyone prefers beauty to virtue, what is this but the real
and utter dishonour of the soul? For such a preference implies that
the body is more honourable than the soul; and this is false, for
there is nothing of earthly birth which is more honourable than the
heavenly, and he who thinks otherwise of the soul has no idea how
greatly he undervalues this wonderful possession.’<a id="FNanchor_47_47" href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span></p>


<h3><a id="II-II"></a>II.</h3>

<p>Thus much for the current prejudices which seemed likely
to interfere with a favourable consideration of our subject.
We have next to study the conditions by which the form of
Greek ethical philosophy was originally determined.
Foremost among these must be placed the moral conceptions
already current long before systematic reflection could begin.
What they were may be partly gathered from some wise saws
attributed by the Greeks themselves to their Seven Sages, but
probably current at a much earlier period. The pith of these
maxims, taken collectively, is to recommend the qualities attributed
by our own philosophic poet to his perfect woman:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">‘The reason firm, the temperate will,</div>
  <div class="verse">Endurance, foresight, strength, and skill.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>We may say almost as briefly that they inculcate complete
independence both of our own passions and of external circumstances,
with a corresponding respect for the independence
of others, to be shown by using persuasion instead of force.
Their tone will perhaps be best understood by contrast with
that collection of Hebrew proverbs which has come down to
us under the name of Solomon, but which Biblical critics now
attribute to a later period and a divided authorship. While
these regularly put forward material prosperity as the chief
motive to good conduct, Hellenic wisdom teaches indifference
to the variations of fortune. To a Greek, ‘the power that
makes for righteousness,’ so far from being, ‘not ourselves,’
was our own truest self, the far-seeing reason which should
guard us from elation and from depression, from passion and
from surprise. Instead of being offered old age as a reward,
we are told to be equally prepared for a long and for a short
life.</p>

<p>Two precepts stand out before all others, which, trivial as
they may seem, are uttered from the very soul of Greek<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
experience, ‘Be moderate,’ and, ‘Know thyself.’ Their joint
observance constitutes the characteristic virtue of Sôphrosynê,
which means all that we understand by temperance, and a great
deal more besides; so much, in fact, that very clever Greeks
were hard set to define it, and very wise Greeks could pray
for it as the fairest gift of the gods.<a id="FNanchor_48_48" href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> Let us suppose that each
individual has a sphere of activity marked out for him by his
own nature and his special environment; then to discern clearly
the limits of that sphere and to keep within them would
be Sôphrosynê, while the discernment, taken alone, would be
wisdom. The same self-restraint operating as a check on
interference with other spheres would be justice; while the
expansive force by which a man fills up his entire sphere and
guards it against aggressions may be called courage. Thus
we are enabled to comprehend the many-sided significance of
Sôphrosynê, to see how it could stand both for a particular
virtue and for all virtuousness whatever. We need only glance
at Homer’s poems, and in particular at the <cite>Iliad</cite>—a much
deeper as well as a more brilliant work than the <cite>Odyssey</cite>—to
perceive how very early this demand for moderation combined
with self-knowledge had embodied itself in Greek
thought. Agamemnon violates the rights of Achilles under
the influence of immoderate passion, and through ignorance of
how little we can accomplish without the hero’s assistance.
Achilles, again, carries his vindictiveness too far, and suffers in
consequence. But his self-knowledge is absolutely perfect;
conscious that he is first in the field while others are better in
council, he never undertakes a task to which his powers are
not fully adequate; nor does he enter on his final work of
vengeance without a clear consciousness of the speedy death
which its completion will entail on himself. Hector, too, notwithstanding
ominous forebodings, knows his duty and does
it, but with much less just an estimate of his own powers,
leading him to pursue his success too far, and then, when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
tide has turned, not permitting him to make a timely retreat
within the walls of Troy. So with the secondary characters.
Patroclus also oversteps the limits of moderation, and pays
the penalty with his life. Diomed silently bears the unmerited
rebuke of Agamemnon, but afterwards recalls it at a most
effective moment, when rising to oppose the craven counsels
of the great king. This the Greeks called observing opportunity,
and opportunism was with them, as with French politicians,
a form of moderation.<a id="FNanchor_49_49" href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> Down at the very bottom of
the scale Thersites and Dolon are signal examples of men
who do not know their sphere and suffer for their folly. In
the <cite>Odyssey</cite>, Odysseus is a nearly perfect type of wisdom
joined with self-control, erring, if we remember rightly, only
once, when he insults Polyphemus before the ship is out of
danger; while his comrades perish from want of these same
gifts.</p>

<p>So far, virtue was with the Greeks what it must inevitably
be with all men at first, chiefly self-regarding, a refined form
of prudence. Moreover, other-regarding virtues gave less scope
for reflection, being originally comprehended under obedience
to the law. But there were two circumstances which could
not long escape their notice; first, that fraud and violence
are often, at least apparently, profitable to those who perpetrate
them, a fact bitterly remarked by Hesiod;<a id="FNanchor_50_50" href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> and secondly,
that society cannot hold together without justice. It was
long before Governments grew up willing and able to protect
their subjects from mutual aggressions, nor does positive law
create morality, but implies it, and could not be worked without
it. Nor could international obligations be enforced by a
superior tribunal; hence they have remained down to the
present day a fertile theme for ethical discussion. It is at
this point that morality forms a junction with religion, the
history of which is highly interesting, but which can here be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
only briefly traced. The Olympian divinities, as placed before
us by Homer, are anything but moral. Their conduct towards
each other is that of a dissolute nobility; towards men it is
that of unscrupulous partisans and patrons. A loyal adherence
to friends and gratitude for sacrificial offerings are their
most respectable characteristics, raising them already a little
above the nature-powers whence they were derived. Now,
mark how they first become moralised. It is by being made
witnesses to an oath. Any one who is called in to testify to
a promise feels aggrieved if it is broken, looking on the breach
as an insult to his own dignity. As the Third Commandment
well puts it, his name has been taken in vain. Thus it happened
that the same gods who left every other crime unpunished,
visited perjury with severe and speedy retribution, continued
even after the offender’s death.<a id="FNanchor_51_51" href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> Respect for a contract
is the primary form of moral obligation, and still seems
to possess a peculiar hold over uneducated minds. We see
every day how many persons will abstain from actions which
they know to be immoral because they have given their word
to that effect, not because the actions themselves are wrong.
And for that reason law courts would be more willing to
enforce contracts than to redress injuries. If, then, one person
inflicted damage on another, he might afterwards, in order to
escape retaliation from the injured party, or from his family,
engage to give satisfaction, and the court would compel him
to redeem his promise.<a id="FNanchor_52_52" href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> Thus contract, by procuring redress
for every species of wrong, would gradually extend its own
obligatory character to abstinence from injury in general, and
the divine sanctions primarily invoked on behalf of oaths
would be extended, with them, over the whole domain of
moral conduct.</p>

<p>Nor was this all. Laws and justice once established would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
require to have their origin accounted for, and, according to
the usual genealogical method of the early Greeks, would be
described as children of the gods, who would thus be interested
in their welfare, and would avenge their violation—a stage of
reflection already reached in the <cite>Works and Days</cite> of Hesiod.</p>

<p>Again, when oracles like that at Delphi had obtained
wide-spread renown and authority, they would be consulted,
not only on ceremonial questions and matters of policy, but
also on debateable points of morality. The divine responses,
being unbiassed by personal interest, would necessarily be
given in accordance with received rules of rectitude, and
would be backed by all the terrors of a supernatural sanction.
It might even be dangerous to assume that the god could possibly
give his support to wrong-doing. A story told by
Herodotus proves that such actually was the case.<span class="ref"><a href="#E">E</a></span> There
lived once at Sparta a certain man named Glaucus, who had
acquired so great a reputation for probity that, during the
troublous times of the Persian conquest, a wealthy Milesian
thought it advisable to deposit a large sum of money with
him for safe keeping. After a considerable time the money
was claimed by his children, but the honesty of Glaucus was
not proof against temptation. He pretended to have forgotten
the whole affair, and required a delay of three months
before making up his mind with regard to the validity of their
demand. During that interval he consulted the Delphic
oracle to know whether he might possess himself of the money
by a false oath. The answer was that it would be for his
immediate advantage to do so; all must die, the faithful and
the perjured alike; but Horcus (oath) had a nameless son
swift to pursue without feet, strong to grasp without hands,
who would destroy the whole race of the sinner. Glaucus
craved forgiveness, but was informed that to tempt the god
was equivalent to committing the crime. He went home and
restored the deposit, but his whole family perished utterly
from the land before three generations had passed by.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span></p>

<p>Yet another step remained to take. Punishment must be
transferred from a man’s innocent children to the man himself
in a future life. But the Olympian theology was, originally at
least, powerless to effect this revolution. Its gods, being personifications
of celestial phenomena, had nothing to do with
the dark underworld whither men descended after death.
There existed, however, side by side with the brilliant religion
of courts and camps which Greek poetry has made so
familiar to us, another religion more popular with simple
country-folk,<a id="FNanchor_53_53" href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> to whom war meant ruin, courts of justice a
means invented by kings for exacting bribes, sea-voyages a
senseless imprudence, chariot-racing a sinful waste of money,
and beautiful women drones in the human hive, demons of
extravagance invented by Zeus for the purpose of venting his
spite against mankind. What interest could these poor
people take in the resplendent guardians of their hereditary
oppressors, in Hêrê and Athênê, Apollo and Poseidôn,
Artemis and Aphroditê? But they had other gods peculiar
to themselves, whose worship was wrapped in mystery, partly
that its objects need not be lured away by the attraction of
richer offerings elsewhere, partly because the activity of these
Chthonian deities, as they were called, was naturally associated
with darkness and secresy. Presiding over birth and death,
over seed-time and harvest and vintage, they personified the
frost-bound sleep of vegetation in winter and its return from
a dark underworld in spring. Out of their worship grew
stories which told how Persephonê, the fair daughter of
Dêmêtêr, or Mother Earth, was carried away by Pluto to
reign with him over the shades below, but after long searching
was restored to her mother for eight months in every year;
and how Dionysus, the wine-god, was twice born, first from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
the earth burned up and fainting under the intolerable fire of
a summer sky, respectively personified as Semelê and her
lover Zeus, then from the protecting mist wrapped round him
by his divine father, of whom it formed a part. Dionysus,
too, was subject to alternations of depression and triumph,
from the recital of which Attic drama was developed, and
gained a footing in the infernal regions, whither we accompany
him in the <cite>Frogs</cite> of Aristophanes. Another country
god was Hermês, who seems to have been associated with
planting and possession as well as with the demarcation and
exchange of property, and who was also a conductor of souls
to Hades. Finally, there were the Erinyes, children of night
and dwellers in subterranean darkness; they could breed
pestilence and discord, but could also avert them; they could
blast the produce of the soil or increase its luxuriance and
fertility; when blood was spilt on the ground, they made it
blossom up again in a harvest of retributive hatred; they pursued
the guilty during life, and did not relax their grasp after
death; all law, whether physical or moral, was under their
protection; the same Erinyes who, in the <cite>Odyssey</cite>, avenge
on Oedipus the suicide of his mother, in the <cite>Iliad</cite> will not
allow the miraculous speaking of a horse to continue; and
we have seen in the last chapter how, according to Heracleitus,
it is they who also prevent the sun from transgressing his
appointed limits.<a id="FNanchor_54_54" href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> Dêmêtêr and Persephonê, too, seem to
have been law-giving goddesses, as their great festival, celebrated
by women alone, was called the Thesmophoria, while
eternal happiness was promised to those who had been initiated
into their mysteries at Eleusis; and we also find that
moral maxims were graven on the marble busts of Hermês
placed along every thoroughfare in Athens. We can thus
understand why the mutilation of these Hermae caused such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
rage and terror, accompanied, as it was rumoured to be, by a
profanation of the Eleusinian mysteries; for any attack on the
deities in question would seem to prefigure an attack on the
settled order of things, the popular rights which they both
symbolised and protected.</p>

<p>Here, then, we find, chiefly among the rustic population,
a religion intimately associated with morality, and including
the doctrine of retribution after death. But this simple faith,
though well adapted to the few wants of its original votaries,
could not be raised to the utmost expansion and purity of
which it was susceptible without being brought into vivifying
contact with that other Olympian religion which, as we have
seen, belonged more peculiarly to the ruling aristocracy. The
poor may be more moral than the rich, and the country than
the town; nevertheless it is from dwellers in cities, and from
the higher classes, including as they do a large percentage of
educated, open-minded individuals, that the impulses to
moral progress always proceed. If the narrowness and hardness
of primitive social arrangements were overcome; if
justice was disengaged from the ties of blood-relationship,
and tempered with consideration for inevitable error; if
deadly feuds were terminated by a habitual appeal to arbitration;
if the worship of one supreme ideal was substituted for
a blind sympathy with the ebb and flow of life on earth; if
the numerical strength of states was increased by giving
shelter to fugitives; if a Hellenic nation was created and
held together by a common literature and a common civilisation,
by oracles accessible to all, and by periodical games
in which every free-born Greek could take part; and, lastly,
if a brighter abode than the slumberous garden of Persephonê
was assigned after death to the godlike heroes who had come
forth from a thrice repeated ordeal with souls unstained by
sin;<a id="FNanchor_55_55" href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a>—all this was due to the military rather than to the
industrial classes, to the spirit that breathes through Homer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
rather than to the tamer inspiration of Hesiod’s muse. But
if justice was raised to an Olympian throne; if righteous providence,
no less than creative power, became an inalienable
attribute of Zeus; if lyric poetry, from Archilochus to
Simonides and Pindar, is one long hymn of prayer and
praise ever turned upward in adoring love to the Divine; we
must remember that Themis was a synonyme for Earth, and
that Prometheus, the original friend of humanity, for whose
benefit he invented every useful art, augury included, was her
son. The seeds of immortal hope were first planted in the
fructifying bosom of Dêmêtêr, and life, a forsaken Ariadnê,
took refuge in the mystical embraces of Dionysus from the
memory of a promise that had allured her to betray. Thus,
we may conjecture that between hall and farm-house, between
the Olympian and the Chthonian religions, there was a constant
reaction going on, during which ethical ideas were continually
expanding, and extricating themselves from the
superstitious elements associated with their earliest theological
expression.</p>


<h3><a id="II-III"></a>III.</h3>

<p>This process was conceived by Aeschylus as a conflict
between two generations of gods, ending with their complete
reconciliation. In the <cite>Prometheus Bound</cite> we have the commencement
of the conflict, in the <cite>Eumenides</cite> its close. Our
sympathies are apparently at first intended to be enlisted on
behalf of the older divinities, but at last are claimed exclusively
by the younger. As opposed to Prometheus, Zeus is
evidently in the wrong, and seeks to make up for his deficiencies
by arbitrary violence. In the <cite>Oresteia</cite> he is the
champion of justice against iniquity, and through his interpreter,
Apollo, he enforces a revised moral code against the
antiquated claims of the Erinyes; these latter, however, ultimately
consenting to become guardians of the new social<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
order. The Aeschylean drama shows us Greek religion at the
highest level it could reach, unaided by philosophical reflection.
With Sophocles a perceptible decline has already
begun. We are loth to say anything that may sound like
disparagement of so noble a poet. We yield to none in
admiration for one who has combined the two highest
qualities of art—sweetness and strength—more completely
than any other singer, Homer alone excepted, and who has
given the primordial affections their definitive expression for
all time. But we cannot help perceiving an element of
superstition in his dramas, which, so far, distinguishes
them unfavourably from those of his Titanic predecessor.
With Sophocles, when the gods interfere, it is to punish
disrespect towards themselves, not to enforce justice between
man and man. Ajax perishes by his own hand because he
has neglected to ask for divine assistance in battle. Laius
and Jocastê come to a tragic end through disobedience to a
perfectly arbitrary oracle; and as a part of the same divine
purpose Oedipus encounters the most frightful calamities by
no fault of his own. The gods are, moreover, exclusively
objects of fear; their sole business is to enforce the fulfilment
of enigmatic prophecies; they give no assistance to the pious
and virtuous characters. Antigonê is allowed to perish for
having performed the last duties to her brother’s corpse.
Neoptolemus receives no aid in that struggle between ambition
on the one hand with truthfulness and pity on the other
which makes his character one of the most interesting
in all imaginative literature. When Athênê bids Odysseus
exult over the degradation of Ajax, the generous Ithacan
refuses to her face, and falls back on the consciousness of a
common humanity uniting him in sympathy with his prostrate
foe.</p>

<p>The rift within the lute went on widening till all its
music was turned to jarring discord. With the third great
Attic dramatist we arrive at a period of complete dissolution.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
Morality is not only separated from mythological tradition,
but is openly at war with it. Religious belief, after becoming
almost monotheistic, has relapsed into polytheism. With
Euripides the gods do not, as with his predecessors, form a
common council. They lead an independent existence, not
interfering with each other, and pursuing private ends of their
own—often very disreputable ones. Aphrodite inspires
Phaedra with an incestuous passion for her stepson. Artemis
is propitiated by human sacrifices. Hêrê causes Heraclês to
kill his children in a fit of delirium. Zeus and Poseidôn are
charged with breaking their own laws, and setting a bad
example to mortals. Apollo, once so venerated, fares the
worst of any. He outrages a noble maiden, and succeeds in
palming off her child on the man whom she subsequently
marries. He instigates the murder of a repentant enemy
who has come to seek forgiveness at his shrine. He fails to
protect Orestes from the consequences of matricide, committed
at his own unwise suggestion. Political animosity
may have had something to do with these attacks on a god
who was believed to side with the Dorian confederacy against
Athens. Doubtless, also, Euripides disbelieved many of the
scandalous stories which he selected as appropriate materials
for dramatic representation. But a satire on immoral beliefs
would have been unnecessary had they not been generally
accepted. Nor was the poet himself altogether a freethinker.
One of his latest and most splendid works, the <cite>Bacchae</cite>, is
a formal submission to the orthodox creed. Under the
stimulus of an insane delusion, Pentheus is torn to pieces by
his mother Agavê and her attendant Maenads, for having
presumed to oppose the introduction of Dionysus-worship
into Thebes. The antecedents of the new divinity are questionable,
and the nature of his influence on the female
population extremely suspicious. Yet much stress is laid on
the impiety of Pentheus, and we are clearly intended to consider
his fate as well-deserved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span></p>

<p>Euripides is not a true thinker, and for that very reason
fitly typifies a period when religion had been shaken to its
very foundation, but still retained a strong hold on men’s
minds, and might at any time reassert its ancient authority
with unexpected vigour. We gather, also, from his writings,
that ethical sentiment had undergone a parallel transformation.
He introduces characters and actions which the elder
dramatists would have rejected as unworthy of tragedy, and
not only introduces them, but composes elaborate speeches in
their defence. Side by side with examples of devoted heroism
we find such observations as that everyone loves himself
best, and that those are most prosperous who attend most
exclusively to their own interests. It so happens that in one
instance where Euripides has chosen a subject already handled
by Aeschylus, the difference of treatment shows how great a
moral revolution had occurred in the interim. The conflict
waged between Eteoclês and Polyneicês for their father’s
throne is the theme both of the <cite>Seven against Thebes</cite> and of
the <cite>Phoenician Women</cite>. In both, Polyneicês bases his claim
on grounds of right. It had been agreed that he and his
brother should alternately hold sway over Thebes. His
turn has arrived, and Eteoclês refuses to give way. Polyneicês
endeavours to enforce his pretensions by bringing a
foreign army against Thebes. Aeschylus makes him appear
before the walls with an allegorical figure of Justice on his
shield, promising to restore him to his father’s seat. On
hearing this, Eteoclês exclaims:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">‘Aye, if Jove’s virgin daughter Justice shared</div>
  <div class="verse">In deed or thought of his, then it might be.</div>
  <div class="verse">But neither when he left the darkling womb,</div>
  <div class="verse">Nor in his childhood, nor in youth, nor when</div>
  <div class="verse">The clustering hair first gathered round his chin,</div>
  <div class="verse">Hath Justice turned approving eyes on him;</div>
  <div class="verse">Nor deem I that she comes as his ally,</div>
  <div class="verse">Now that he wastes his native land with war,</div>
  <div class="verse">Or Justice most unjustly were she called</div>
  <div class="verse">If ruthless hearts could claim her fellowship.’<a id="FNanchor_56_56" href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span></p>
<p>Euripides, with greater dramatic skill, brings the two brothers
together in presence of their mother, Jocastê. When Polyneicês
has spoken, Eteoclês replies:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">‘Honour and wisdom are but empty names</div>
  <div class="verse">That mortals use, each with a different meaning,</div>
  <div class="verse">Agreeing in the sound, not in the sense.</div>
  <div class="verse">Hear, mother, undisguised my whole resolve!</div>
  <div class="verse">Were Sovereignty, chief goddess among gods,</div>
  <div class="verse">Far set as is the rising of a star,</div>
  <div class="verse">Or buried deep in subterranean gloom,</div>
  <div class="verse">There I would seek and win her for mine own.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">

<hr class="tb" /></div>
</div><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Come fire, come sword, yoke horses to the car,</div>
  <div class="verse">And fill the plain with armed men, for I</div>
  <div class="verse">Will not give up my royalty to him!</div>
  <div class="verse">Let all my life be guiltless save in this:</div>
  <div class="verse">I dare do any wrong for sovereign power—</div>
  <div class="verse">The splendid guerdon of a splendid sin.’<a id="FNanchor_57_57" href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The contrast is not only direct, but designed, for Euripides
had the work of his predecessor before him, and no doubt
imagined that he was improving on it.</p>

<p>We perceive a precisely similar change of tone on comparing
the two great historians who have respectively recorded
the struggle of Greece against Persia, and the struggle
of imperial Athens against Sparta and her allies. Though
born within fifteen years of one another, Herodotus and
Thucydides are virtually separated by an interval of two
generations, for while the latter represents the most advanced
thought of his time, the former lived among traditions inherited
from the age preceding his own. Now, Herodotus is
not more remarkable for the earnest piety than for the clear
sense of justice which runs through his entire work. He
draws no distinction between public and private morality.
Whoever makes war on his neighbours without provocation,
or rules without the consent of the governed, is, according
to him, in the wrong, although he is well aware that such
wrongs are constantly committed. Thucydides knows nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
of supernatural interference in human affairs. After relating
the tragical end of Nicias, he observes, not without a sceptical
tendency, that of all the Greeks then living, this unfortunate
general least deserved such a fate, so far as piety and
respectability of character went. If there are gods they hold
their position by superior strength. That the strong should
enslave the weak is a universal and necessary law of Nature.
The Spartans, who among themselves are most scrupulous
in observing traditional obligations, in their dealings with
others most openly identify gain with honour, and expediency
with right. Even if the historian himself did not
share these opinions, it is evident that they were widely
entertained by his contemporaries, and he expressly informs
us that Greek political morality had deteriorated to a frightful
extent in consequence of the civil discords fomented by
the conflict between Athens and Sparta; while, in Athens at
least, a similar corruption of private morality had begun with
the great plague of 430, its chief symptom being a mad desire
to extract the utmost possible enjoyment from life, for which
purpose every means was considered legitimate. On this
point Thucydides is confirmed and supplemented by the
evidence of another contemporary authority. According to
Aristophanes, the ancient discipline had in his time become
very much relaxed. The rich were idle and extravagant;
the poor mutinous; young men were growing more and more
insolent to their elders; religion was derided; all classes
were animated by a common desire to make money and
to spend it on sensual enjoyment. Only, instead of tracing
back this profound demoralisation to a change in the social
environment, Aristophanes attributes it to demagogues,
harassing informers, and popular poets, but above all to the
new culture then coming into vogue. Physical science had
brought in atheism; dialectic training had destroyed the
sanctity of ethical restraints. When, however, the religious
and virtuous Socrates is put forward as a type of both tend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>encies,
our confidence in the comic poet’s accuracy, if not in
his good faith, becomes seriously shaken; and his whole tone
so vividly recalls the analogous invectives now hurled from
press and pulpit against every philosophic theory, every
scientific discovery, every social reform at variance with
traditional beliefs or threatening the sinister interests which
have gathered round iniquitous institutions, that at first we
feel tempted to follow Grote in rejecting his testimony altogether.
So far, however, as the actual phenomena themselves
are concerned, and apart from their generating antecedents,
Aristophanes does but bring into more picturesque prominence
what graver observers are content to indicate, and what
Plato, writing a generation later, treats as an unquestionable
reality. Nor is the fact of a lowered moral tone going along
with accelerated mental activity either incredible or unparalleled.
Modern history knows of at least two periods
remarkable for such a conjunction, the Renaissance and the
eighteenth century, the former stained with every imaginable
crime, the latter impure throughout, and lapsing into blood-thirsty
violence at its close. Moral progress, like every other
mode of motion, has its appropriate rhythm—its epochs of
severe restraint followed by epochs of rebellious license. And
when, as an aggravation of the reaction from which they
periodically suffer, ethical principles have become associated
with a mythology whose decay, at first retarded, is finally
hastened by their activity, it is still easier to understand how
they may share in its discredit, and only regain their ascendency
by allying themselves with a purified form of the old
religion, until they can be disentangled from the compromising
support of all unverified theories whatever. We have every
reason to believe that Greek life and thought did pass through
such a crisis during the second half of the fifth century B.C.,
and we have now to deal with the speculative aspects of that
crisis, so far as they are represented by the Sophists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span></p>


<h3><a id="II-IV"></a>IV.</h3>

<p>The word Sophist in modern languages means one who
purposely uses fallacious arguments. Our definition was
probably derived from that given by Aristotle in his <cite>Topics</cite>,
but does not entirely reproduce it. What we call sophistry
was with him eristic, or the art of unfair disputation; and by
Sophist he means one who practises the eristic art for gain.
He also defines sophistry as the appearance without the
reality of wisdom. A very similar account of the Sophists
and their art is given by Plato in what seems to be one of his
later dialogues; and another dialogue, probably composed
some time previously, shows us how eristic was actually
practised by two Sophists, Euthydêmus and Dionysodôrus,
who had learned the art, which is represented as a very easy
accomplishment, when already old men. Their performance
is not edifying; and one only wonders how any Greek could
have been induced to pay for the privilege of witnessing such
an exhibition. But the word Sophist, in its original signification,
was an entirely honourable name. It meant a sage, a
wise and learned man, like Solon, or, for that matter, like
Plato and Aristotle themselves. The interval between these
widely-different connotations is filled up and explained by a
number of individuals as to whom our information is principally,
though by no means entirely, derived from Plato. All
of them were professional teachers, receiving payment for
their services; all made a particular study of language, some
aiming more particularly at accuracy, others at beauty of
expression. While no common doctrine can be attributed to
them as a class, as individuals they are connected by a series
of graduated transitions, the final outcome of which will
enable us to understand how, from a title of respect, their
name could be turned into a byword of reproach. The
Sophists, concerning whom some details have been trans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>mitted
to us, are Protagoras, Gorgias, Prodicus, Hippias,
Pôlus, Thrasymachus, and the Eristics already mentioned.
We have placed them, so far as their ages can be determined,
in chronological order, but their logical order is somewhat
different. The first two on the list were born about 480 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>,
and the second pair possibly twenty years later. But neither
Protagoras nor Gorgias seems to have published his most
characteristic theories until a rather advanced time of life,
for they are nowhere alluded to by the Xenophontic Socrates,
who, on the other hand, is well acquainted with both Prodicus
and Hippias, while, conversely, Plato is most interested in the
former pair. We shall also presently see that the scepticism
of the elder Sophists can best be explained by reference to
the more dogmatic theories of their younger contemporaries,
which again easily fit on to the physical speculations of earlier
thinkers.</p>

<p>Prodicus was born in Ceos, a little island belonging to the
Athenian confederacy, and seems to have habitually resided
at Athens. His health was delicate, and he wrapped up a
good deal, as we learn from the ridicule of Plato, always
pitiless to a valetudinarian.<span class="ref"><a href="#F">F</a></span> Judging from two allusions in
Aristophanes, he taught natural science in such a manner as
to conciliate even that unsparing enemy of the new learning.<a id="FNanchor_58_58" href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a>
He also gave moral instruction grounded on the traditional
ideas of his country, a pleasing specimen of which has been
preserved. It is conveyed under the form of an apologue,
entitled the Choice of Heraclês, and was taken down in its
present form by Xenophon from the lips of Socrates, who
quoted it, with full approval, for the benefit of his own
disciples. Prodicus also lectured on the use of words,
laying especial emphasis on the distinction of synonyms. We
hear, not without sympathy, that he tried to check the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
indiscriminate employment of ‘awful’ (δεινός), which was even
more rife at Athens than among ourselves.<span class="ref"><a href="#G">G</a></span> Finally, we are
told that, like many moderns, he considered the popular
divinities to be personifications of natural phenomena.
Hippias, who was a native of Elis, seems to have taught on
very much the same system. It would appear that he
lectured principally on astronomy and physics, but did not
neglect language, and is said to have invented an art of
memory. His restless inquisitiveness was also exercised on
ancient history, and his erudition in that subject was taxed
to the utmost during a visit to Sparta, where the unlettered
people still delighted in old stories, which among the more
enlightened Greeks had been superseded by topics of livelier
and fresher interest. At Sparta, too, he recited, with great
applause, an ethical discourse under the form of advice given
by Nestor to Neoptolemus after the capture of Troy. We
know, on good authority, that Hippias habitually distinguished
between natural and customary law, the former
being, according to him, everywhere the same, while the latter
varied from state to state, and in the same state at different
times. Natural law he held to be alone binding and
alone salutary. On this subject the following expressions,
evidently intended to be characteristic, are put into his mouth
by Plato:—‘All of you who are here present I reckon to be
kinsmen and friends and fellow-citizens, by nature and not by
law; for by nature like is akin to like, whereas law is the
tyrant of mankind, and often compels us to do many things
which are against Nature.’<a id="FNanchor_59_59" href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> Here two distinct ideas are
implied, the idea that Nature is a moral guide, and, further,
the idea that she is opposed to convention. The habit of
looking for examples and lessons to some simpler life than
their own prevailed among the Greeks from a very early
period, and is, indeed, very common in primitive societies.
Homer’s similes are a case in point; while all that we are told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
about the innocence and felicity of the Aethiopians and
Hyperboreans seems to indicate a deep-rooted belief in the
moral superiority of savage to civilised nations; and Hesiod’s
fiction of the Four Ages, beginning with a golden age, arises
from a kindred notion that intellectual progress is accompanied
by moral corruption. Simonides of Amorgus illustrates
the various types of womankind by examples from the
animal world; and Aesop’s fables, dating from the first half
of the sixth century, give ethical instruction under the same
disguise. We have already pointed out how Greek rural
religion established a thorough-going connexion between
physical and moral phenomena, and how Heracleitus followed
in the same track. Now, one great result of early
Greek thought, as described in our first chapter, was to
combine all these scattered fugitive incoherent ideas under
a single conception, thus enabling them to elucidate and
support one another. This was the conception of Nature as a
universal all-creative eternal power, first superior to the gods,
then altogether superseding them. When Homer called Zeus
the father of gods and men; when Pindar said that both races,
the divine and the human, are sprung from one mother
(Earth);<a id="FNanchor_60_60" href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> when, again, he spoke of law as an absolute king;
or when Aeschylus set destiny above Zeus himself;<a id="FNanchor_61_61" href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> they
were but foreshadowing a more despotic authority, whose
dominion is even now not extinct, is perhaps being renewed
under the title of Evolution. The word Nature was used by
most philosophers, and the thing was implied by all. They
did not, indeed, commit the mistake of personifying a convenient
abstraction; but a conception which they substituted
for the gods would soon inherit every attribute of divine
agency. Moreover, the Nature of philosophy had three
fundamental attributes admitting of ready application as
ethical standards. She was everywhere the same; fire
burned in Greece and Persia alike. She tended towards an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
orderly system where every agent or element is limited to
its appropriate sphere. And she proceeded on a principle of
universal compensation, all gains in one direction being paid
for by losses in another, and every disturbance being
eventually rectified by a restoration of equilibrium. It was,
indeed, by no means surprising that truths which were
generalised from the experience of Greek social life should
now return to confirm the orderliness of that life with the
sanction of an all-pervading law.</p>

<p>Euripides gives us an interesting example of the style in
which this ethical application of physical science could be
practised. We have seen how Eteoclês expresses his determination
to do and dare all for the sake of sovereign power.
His mother, Jocastê, gently rebukes him as follows:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">‘Honour Equality who binds together</div>
  <div class="verse">Both friends and cities and confederates,</div>
  <div class="verse">For equity is law, law equity;</div>
  <div class="verse">The lesser is the greater’s enemy,</div>
  <div class="verse">And disadvantaged aye begins the strife.</div>
  <div class="verse">From her our measures, weights, and numbers come,</div>
  <div class="verse">Defined and ordered by Equality;</div>
  <div class="verse">So do the night’s blind eye and sun’s bright orb</div>
  <div class="verse">Walk equal courses in their yearly round,</div>
  <div class="verse">And neither is embittered by defeat;</div>
  <div class="verse">And while both light and darkness serve mankind</div>
  <div class="verse">Wilt thou not bear an equal in thy house?’<a id="FNanchor_62_62" href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>On examining the apologue of Prodicus, we find it
characterised by a somewhat similar style of reasoning.
There is, it is true, no reference to physical phenomena, but
Virtue dwells strongly on the truth that nothing can be had
for nothing, and that pleasure must either be purchased by
toil or atoned for by languor, satiety, and premature decay.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
We know also that the Cynical school, as represented by
Antisthenês, rejected all pleasure on the ground that it was
always paid for by an equal amount of pain; and Heraclês,
the Prodicean type of a youth who follows virtue in preference
to vice disguised as happiness, was also the favourite
hero of the Cynics. Again, Plato alludes, in the <cite>Philêbus</cite>,
to certain thinkers, reputed to be ‘great on the subject of
physics,’ who deny the very existence of pleasure. Critics
have been at a loss to identify these persons, and rather
reluctantly put up with the explanation that Antisthenês and
his school are referred to. Antisthenês was a friend of
Prodicus, and may at one time have shared in his scientific
studies, thus giving occasion to the association touched on by
Plato. But is it not equally possible that Prodicus left
behind disciples who, like him, combined moral with physical
teaching; and, going a little further, may we not conjecture
that their opposition to Hedonism was inherited from the
master himself, who, like the Stoics afterwards, may have
based it on an application of physical reasoning to ethics?</p>

<p>Still more important was the antithesis between Nature
and convention, which, so far as we know, originated exclusively
with Hippias. We have already observed that
universality and necessity were, with the Greeks, standing
marks of naturalness. The customs of different countries
were, on the other hand, distinguished by extreme variety,
amounting sometimes to diametrical opposition. Herodotus
was fond of calling attention to such contrasts; only, he
drew from them the conclusion that law, to be so arbitrary,
must needs possess supreme and sacred authority. According
to the more plausible interpretation of Hippias, the variety,
and at least in Greek democracies, the changeability of law
proved that it was neither sacred nor binding. He also
looked on artificial social institutions as the sole cause of
division and discord among mankind. Here we already see the
dawn of a cosmopolitanism afterwards preached by Cynic and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
Stoic philosophers. Furthermore, to discover the natural rule of
right, he compared the laws of different nations, and selected
those which were held by all in common as the basis of an
ethical system.<a id="FNanchor_63_63" href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> Now, this is precisely what was done by
the Roman jurists long afterwards under the inspiration of
Stoical teaching. We have it on the high authority of Sir
Henry Maine that they identified the <i lang="la">Jus Gentium</i>, that
is, the laws supposed to be observed by all nations alike,
with the <i lang="la">Jus Naturale</i>, that is, the code by which men were
governed in their primitive condition of innocence. It was
by a gradual application of this ideal standard that the
numerous inequalities between different classes of persons,
enforced by ancient Roman law, were removed, and that
contract was substituted for status. Above all, the abolition
of slavery was, if not directly caused, at any rate powerfully
aided, by the belief that it was against Nature. At the
beginning of the fourteenth century we find Louis Hutin,
King of France, assigning as a reason for the enfranchisement
of his serfs, that, ‘according to natural law, everybody
ought to be born free,’ and although Sir H. Maine holds this
to have been a mistaken interpretation of the juridical axiom
‘omnes homines naturâ aequales sunt,’ which means not an
ideal to be attained, but a primitive condition from which we
have departed: nevertheless it very faithfully reproduces the
theory of those Greek philosophers from whom the idea of a
natural law was derived. That, in Aristotle’s time at least,
a party existed who were opposed to slavery on theoretical
grounds of right is perfectly evident from the language of the
<cite>Politics</cite>. ‘Some persons,’ says Aristotle, ‘think that slave-holding
is against nature, for that one man is a slave and
another free by law, while by nature there is no difference
between them, for which reason it is unjust as being the
result of force.’<a id="FNanchor_64_64" href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> And he proceeds to prove the contrary at
length. The same doctrine of natural equality led to important
political consequences, having, again according to Sir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
H. Maine, contributed both to the American Declaration of
Independence and to the French Revolution.</p>

<p>There is one more aspect deserving our attention, under
which the theory of Nature has been presented both in
ancient and modern times. A dialogue which, whether
rightly or wrongly attributed to Plato, may be taken as good
evidence on the subject it relates to,<a id="FNanchor_65_65" href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> exhibits Hippias in the
character of a universal genius, who can not only teach every
science and practise every kind of literary composition, but
has also manufactured all the clothes and other articles about
his person. Here we have precisely the sort of versatility which
characterises uncivilised society, and which believers in a
state of nature love to encourage at all times. The division
of labour, while it carries us ever farther from barbarism,
makes us more dependent on each other. An Odysseus is
master of many arts, a Themistocles of two, a Demosthenes
of only one. A Norwegian peasant can do more for himself
than an English countryman, and therefore makes a better
colonist. If we must return to Nature, our first step should
be to learn a number of trades, and so be better able to shift
for ourselves. Such was the ideal of Hippias, and it was also
the ideal of the eighteenth century. Its literature begins
with <cite>Robinson Crusoe</cite>, the story of a man who is accidentally
compelled to provide himself, during many years, with
all the necessaries of life. Its educational manuals are, in
France, Rousseau’s <cite>Émile</cite>; in England, Day’s <cite>Sandford
and Merton</cite>, both teaching that the young should be thrown
as much as possible on their own resources. One of its types
is Diderot, who learns handicrafts that he may describe them
in the <cite>Encyclopédie</cite>. Its two great spokesmen are Voltaire
and Goethe, who, after cultivating every department of literature,
take in statesmanship as well. And its last word is
Schiller’s <cite>Letters on Aesthetic Culture</cite>, holding up totality
of existence as the supreme ideal to be sought after.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span></p>

<p>There is no reason to believe that Hippias used his distinction
between Nature and convention as an argument for
despotism. It would rather appear that, if anything, he and
his school desired to establish a more complete equality
among men. Others, however, both rhetoricians and practical
statesmen, were not slow to draw an opposite conclusion.
They saw that where no law was recognised, as between
different nations, nothing but violence and the right of the
stronger prevailed. It was once believed that aggressions
which human law could not reach found no favour with the
gods, and dread of the divine displeasure may have done
something towards restraining them. But religion had partly
been destroyed by the new culture, partly perverted into a
sanction for wrong-doing. By what right, it was asked, did
Zeus himself reign? Had he not unlawfully dethroned his
father, Cronos, and did he not now hold power simply by
virtue of superior strength? Similar reasonings were soon
applied to the internal government of each state. It was
alleged that the ablest citizens could lay claim to uncontrolled
supremacy by a title older than any social fiction.
Rules of right meant nothing but a permanent conspiracy of
the weak to withdraw themselves from the legitimate dominion
of their born master, and to bamboozle him into a voluntary
surrender of his natural privileges. Sentiments bearing a
superficial resemblance to these have occasionally found
utterance among ourselves. Nevertheless, it would be most
unjust to compare Carlyle and Mr. Froude with Critias and
Calliclês. We believe that their preference of despotism to
representative government is an entire mistake. But we
know that with them as with us the good of the governed
is the sole end desired. The gentlemen of Athens sought
after supreme power only as a means for gratifying their
worst passions without let or hindrance; and for that purpose
they were ready to ally themselves with every foreign enemy
in turn, or to flatter the caprices of the Dêmos, if that policy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
promised to answer equally well. The antisocial theories of
these ‘young lions,’ as they were called by their enemies and
sometimes by themselves also, do not seem to have been
supported by any public teacher. If we are to believe Plato,
Pôlus, a Sicilian rhetor, did indeed regard Archelaus, the
abler Louis Napoleon of his time, with sympathy and envious
admiration, but without attempting to justify the crimes of
his hero by an appeal to natural law. The corruption of
theoretical morality among the paid teachers took a more
subtle form. Instead of opposing one principle to another,
they held that all law had the same source, being an emanation
from the will of the stronger, and exclusively designed
to promote his interest. Justice, according to Thrasymachus
in the <cite>Republic</cite>, is another’s good, which is true enough, and
to practise it except under compulsion is foolish, which, whatever
Grote may say, is a grossly immoral doctrine.</p>


<h3><a id="II-V"></a>V.</h3>

<p>We have seen how the idea of Nature, first evolved by
physical philosophy, was taken by some, at least, among the
Sophists as a basis for their ethical teaching; then how an
interpretation utterly opposed to theirs was put on it by
practical men, and how this second interpretation was so
generalised by the younger rhetoricians as to involve the
denial of all morality whatever. Meanwhile, another equally
important conception, destined to come into speedy and
prolonged antagonism with the idea of Nature, and like it to
exercise a powerful influence on ethical reflection, had
almost contemporaneously been elaborated out of the
materials which earlier speculation supplied. From Parmenides
and Heracleitus down, every philosopher who had
propounded a theory of the world, had also more or less
peremptorily insisted on the fact that his theory differed
widely from common belief. Those who held that change is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
impossible, and those who taught that everything is
incessantly changing; those who asserted the indestructibility
of matter, and those who denied its continuity; those who
took away objective reality from every quality except
extension and resistance, and those who affirmed that the
smallest molecules partook more or less of every attribute
that is revealed to sense—all these, however much they
might disagree among themselves, agreed in declaring that
the received opinions of mankind were an utter delusion.
Thus, a sharp distinction came to be drawn between the
misleading sense-impressions and the objective reality to
which thought alone could penetrate. It was by combining
these two elements, sensation and thought, that the idea of
mind was originally constituted. And mind when so understood
could not well be accounted for by any of the
materialistic hypotheses at first proposed. The senses must
differ profoundly from that of which they give such an
unfaithful report; while reason, which Anaxagoras had so
carefully differentiated from every other form of existence,
carried back its distinction to the subjective sphere, and
became clothed with a new spirituality when reintegrated in
the consciousness of man.</p>

<p>The first result of this separation between man and the
world was a complete breach with the old physical philosophy,
shown, on the one hand, by an abandonment of
speculative studies, on the other, by a substitution of convention
for Nature as the recognised standard of right.
Both consequences were drawn by Protagoras, the most
eminent of the Sophists. We have now to consider more
particularly what was his part in the great drama of which
we are attempting to give an intelligible account.</p>

<p>Protagoras was born about 480 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> He was a fellow-townsman
of Democritus, and has been represented, though
not on good authority, as a disciple of that illustrious
thinker. It was rather by a study of Heracleitus that his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
philosophical opinions, so far as they were borrowed from
others, seem to have been most decisively determined. In
any case, practice, not theory, was the principal occupation of
his life. He gave instruction for payment in the higher
branches of a liberal education, and adopted the name of
Sophist, which before had simply meant a wise man, as an
honourable title for his new calling. Protagoras was a very
popular teacher. The news of his arrival in a strange city
excited immense enthusiasm, and he was followed from
place to place by a band of eager disciples. At Athens he
was honoured by the friendship of such men as Pericles and
Euripides. It was at the house of the great tragic poet that
he read out a work beginning with the ominous declaration,
‘I cannot tell whether the gods exist or not; life is too short
for such difficult investigations.’<a id="FNanchor_66_66" href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> Athenian bigotry took
alarm directly. The book containing this frank confession
of agnosticism was publicly burned, all purchasers being
compelled to give up the copies in their possession. The
author himself was either banished or took flight, and
perished by shipwreck on the way to Sicily before completing
his seventieth year.</p>

<p>The scepticism of Protagoras went beyond theology and
extended to all science whatever. Such, at least, seems to
have been the force of his celebrated declaration that ‘man
is the measure of all things, both as regards their existence
and their non-existence.’<a id="FNanchor_67_67" href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> According to Plato, this doctrine
followed from the identification of knowledge with sensible
perception, which in its turn was based on a modified form of
the Heracleitean theory of a perpetual flux. The series of
external changes which constitutes Nature, acting on the
series of internal changes which constitutes each man’s
personality, produces particular sensations, and these alone
are the true reality. They vary with every variation in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
factors, and therefore are not the same for separate individuals.
Each man’s perceptions are true for himself, but for himself
alone. Plato easily shows that such a theory of truth is at
variance with ordinary opinion, and that if all opinions are
true, it must necessarily stand self-condemned. We may also
observe that if nothing can be known but sensation, nothing
can be known of its conditions. It would, however, be unfair
to convict Protagoras of talking nonsense on the unsupported
authority of the <cite>Theaetêtus</cite>. Plato himself suggests that a
better case might have been made out for the incriminated
doctrine could its author have been heard in self-defence.
We may conjecture that Protagoras did not distinguish very
accurately between existence, knowledge, and applicability to
practice. If we assume, what there seems good reason to
believe, that in the great controversy of Nature <i lang="la">versus</i> Law,
Protagoras sided with the latter, his position will at once
become clear. When the champions of Nature credited her
with a stability and an authority greater than could be claimed
for merely human arrangements, it was a judicious step to
carry the war into their territory, and ask, on what foundation
then does Nature herself stand? Is not she, too, perpetually
changing, and do we not become acquainted with her entirely
through our own feelings? Ought not those feelings to be
taken as the ultimate standard in all questions of right and
wrong? Individual opinion is a fact which must be reckoned
with, but which can be changed by persuasion, not by appeals
to something that we none of us know anything about. <em>Man</em>
is the measure of all things, not the will of gods whose very
existence is uncertain, nor yet a purely hypothetical state of
Nature. Human interests must take precedence of every
other consideration. Hector meant nothing else when he
preferred the obvious dictates of patriotism to inferences
drawn from the flight of birds.</p>

<p>We now understand why Protagoras, in the Platonic
dialogue bearing his name, should glance scornfully at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
method of instruction pursued by Hippias, with his lectures
on astronomy, and why he prefers to discuss obscure passages
in the poets. The quarrel between a classical and a scientific
education was just then beginning, and Protagoras, as a
Humanist, sided with the classics. Again, he does not think
much of the ‘great and sane and noble race of brutes.’ He
would not, like the Cynics, take them as examples of conduct.
Man, he says, is naturally worse provided for than any
animal; even the divine gift of wisdom would not save him
from extinction without the priceless social virtues of justice
and reverence, that is, the regard for public opinion which
Mr. Darwin, too, has represented as the strongest moralising
power in primitive society. And, as the possession of these
qualities constituted the fundamental distinction between men
and brutes, so also did the advantage of civilisation over
barbarism rest on their superior development, a development
due to the ethical instruction received by every citizen from
his earliest infancy, reinforced through after-life by the sterner
correction of legal punishments, and completed by the elimination
of all individuals demonstrably unfitted for the social
state. Protagoras had no sympathy with those who affect
to prefer the simplicity of savages to the fancied corruption
of civilisation. Hear how he answers the Rousseaus and
Diderots of his time:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘I would have you consider that he who appears to you to be the
worst of those who have been brought up in laws and humanities
would appear to be a just man and a master of justice if he were to
be compared with men who had no education, or courts of justice, or
laws, or any restraints upon them which compelled them to practise
virtue—with the savages, for example, whom the poet Pherecrates
exhibited on the stage at the last year’s Lenaean festival. If you
were living among men such as the man-haters in his chorus, you
would be only too glad to meet with Eurybates and Phrynondas, and
you would sorrowfully long to revisit the rascality of this part of the
world.’<a id="FNanchor_68_68" href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span></p>

<p>We find the same theory reproduced and enforced with
weighty illustrations by the great historian of that age. It is
not known whether Thucydides owed any part of his culture
to Protagoras, but the introduction to his history breathes the
same spirit as the observations which we have just transcribed.
He, too, characterises antiquity as a scene of barbarism,
isolation, and lawless violence, particularly remarking that
piracy was not then counted a dishonourable profession. He
points to the tribes outside Greece, together with the most
backward among the Greeks themselves, as representing the
low condition from which Athens and her sister states had
only emerged within a comparatively recent period. And in
the funeral oration which he puts into the mouth of Pericles,
the legendary glories of Athens are passed over without the
slightest allusion,<a id="FNanchor_69_69" href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> while exclusive prominence is given to her
proud position as the intellectual centre of Greece. Evidently
a radical change had taken place in men’s conceptions since
Herodotus wrote. They were learning to despise the
mythical glories of their ancestors, to exalt the present at the
expense of the past, to fix their attention exclusively on
immediate human interests, and, possibly, to anticipate the
coming of a loftier civilisation than had as yet been seen.</p>

<p>The evolution of Greek tragic poetry bears witness to the
same transformation of taste. On comparing Sophocles with
Aeschylus, we are struck by a change of tone analogous to
that which distinguishes Thucydides from Herodotus. It has
been shown in our first chapter how the elder dramatist
delights in tracing events and institutions back to their first
origin, and in following derivations through the steps of a
genealogical sequence. Sophocles, on the other hand, limits
himself to a close analysis of the action immediately
represented, the motives by which his characters are in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>fluenced,
and the arguments by which their conduct is
justified or condemned. We have already touched on the
very different attitude assumed towards religion by these two
great poets. Here we have only to add that while Aeschylus
fills his dramas with supernatural beings, and frequently
restricts his mortal actors to the interpretation or execution
of a divine mandate, Sophocles, representing the spirit of
Greek Humanism, only once brings a god on the stage, and
dwells exclusively on the emotions of pride, ambition, revenge,
terror, pity, and affection, by which men and women of a lofty
type are actuated. Again (and this is one of his poetic
superiorities), Aeschylus has an open sense for the external
world; his imagination ranges far and wide from land to
land; his pages are filled with the fire and light, the music
and movement of Nature in a Southern country. He leads
before us in splendid procession the starry-kirtled night; the
bright rulers that bring round winter and summer; the
dazzling sunshine; the forked flashes of lightning; the
roaring thunder; the white-winged snow-flakes; the rain
descending on thirsty flowers; the sea now rippling with
infinite laughter, now moaning on the shingle, growing hoary
under rough blasts, with its eastern waves dashing against the
new-risen sun, or, again, lulled to waveless, windless, noonday
sleep; the volcano with its volleys of fire-breathing spray
and fierce jaws of devouring lava; the eddying whorls of
dust; the resistless mountain-torrent; the meadow-dews;
the flowers of spring and fruits of summer; the evergreen
olive, and trees that give leafy shelter from dogstar heat.
For all this world of wonder and beauty Sophocles offers only
a few meagre allusions to the phenomena presented by
sunshine and storm. No poet has ever so entirely concentrated
his attention on human deeds and human passions.
Only the grove of Colônus, interwoven with his own earliest
recollections, had power to draw from him, in extreme old age,
a song such as the nightingale might have warbled amid those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
inviolable recesses where the ivy and laurel, the vine and
olive gave a never-failing shelter against sun and wind alike.
Yet even this leafy covert is but an image of the poet’s own
imagination, undisturbed by outward influences, self-involved,
self-protected, and self-sustained. Of course, we are only restating
in different language what has long been known, that
the epic element of poetry, before so prominent, was with
Sophocles entirely displaced by the dramatic; but if Sophocles
became the greatest dramatist of antiquity, it was
precisely because no other writer could, like him, work out a
catastrophe solely through the action of mind on mind,
without any intervention of physical force; and if he
possessed this faculty, it was because Greek thought as a
whole had been turned inward; because he shared in the devotion
to psychological studies equally exemplified by his
younger contemporaries, Protagoras, Thucydides, and Socrates,
all of whom might have taken for their motto the
noble lines—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">‘On earth there is nothing great but man,</div>
  <div class="verse">In man there is nothing great but mind.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>We have said that Protagoras was a partisan of Nomos,
or convention, against Nature. That was the conservative
side of his character. Still, Nomos was not with him what it
had been with the older Greeks, an immutable tradition
indistinguishable from physical law. It was a human
creation, and represented the outcome of inherited experience,
admitting always of change for the better. Hence the vast
importance which he attributed to education. This, no doubt,
was magnifying his own office, for the training of youth was
his profession. But, unquestionably, the feelings of his more
liberal contemporaries went with him. A generation before,
Pindar had spoken scornfully of intellectual culture as a vain
attempt to make up for the absence of genius which the gods
alone could give. Yet Pindar himself was always careful to
dwell on the services rendered by professional trainers to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
victorious athletes whose praises he sang, and there was really
no reason why genius and culture should be permanently
dissociated. A Themistocles might decide offhand on the
questions brought before him; a Pericles, dealing with much
more complex interests, already needed a more careful
preparation.</p>

<p>On the other hand, conservatives like Aristophanes continued
to oppose the spread of education with acrimonious
zeal. Some of their arguments have a curiously familiar
ring. Intellectual pursuits, they said, were bad for the health,
led to irreligion and immorality, made young people quite
unlike their grandfathers, and were somehow or other connected
with loose company and a fast life. This last insinuation
was in one respect the very reverse of true. So far as
personal morality went, nothing could be better for it than
the change introduced by Protagoras from amateur to paid
teaching. Before this time, a Greek youth who wished for
something better than the very elementary instruction given
at school, could only attach himself to some older and wiser
friend, whose conversation might be very improving, but who
was pretty sure to introduce a sentimental element into their
relationship equally discreditable to both.<a id="FNanchor_70_70" href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> A similar danger
has always existed with regard to highly intelligent women,
although it may have threatened a smaller number of individuals;
and the efforts now being made to provide them with
a systematic education under official superintendence will
incidentally have the effect of saving our future Héloises
and Julies from the tuition of an Abélard or a Saint-Preux.</p>

<p>It was their habit of teaching rhetoric as an art which raised
the fiercest storm of indignation against Protagoras and
his colleagues. The endeavour to discover rules for addressing
a tribunal or a popular assembly in the manner best cal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>culated
to win their assent had originated quite independently
of any philosophical theory. On the re-establishment of
order, that is to say of popular government, in Sicily, many
lawsuits arose out of events which had happened years before;
and, owing to the lapse of time, demonstrative evidence was
not available. Accordingly, recourse was had on both sides
to arguments possessing a greater or less degree of probability.
The art of putting such probable inferences so as to
produce persuasion demanded great technical skill; and two
Sicilians, Corax and Tisias by name, composed treatises on
the subject. It would appear that the new-born art was
taken up by Protagoras and developed in the direction of
increased dialectical subtlety. We are informed that he
undertook to make the worse appear the better reason; and
this very soon came to be popularly considered as an accomplishment
taught by all philosophers, Socrates among the
rest. But if Protagoras merely meant that he would teach
the art of reasoning, one hardly sees how he could have expressed
himself otherwise, consistently with the antithetical
style of his age. We should say more simply that a case is
strengthened by the ability to argue it properly. It has not
been shown that the Protagorean dialectic offered exceptional
facilities for maintaining unjust pretensions. Taken, however,
in connexion with the humanistic teaching, it had an unsettling
and sceptical tendency. All belief and all practice rested on
law, and law was the result of a convention made among
men and ultimately produced by individual conviction.
What one man had done another could undo. Religious
tradition and natural right, the sole external standards, had
already disappeared. There remained the test of self-consistency,
and against this all the subtlety of the new dialectic
was turned. The triumph of Eristic was to show that a
speaker had contradicted himself, no matter how his statements
might be worded. Moreover, now that reference to an
objective reality was disallowed, words were put in the place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
of things and treated like concrete realities. The next step
was to tear them out of the grammatical construction, where
alone they possessed any truth or meaning, each being simultaneously
credited with all the uses which at any time it
might be made to fulfil. For example, if a man knew one
thing he knew all, for he had knowledge, and knowledge is of
everything knowable. Much that seems to us tedious or
superfluous in Aristotle’s expositions was intended as a safeguard
against this endless cavilling. Finally, negation itself
was eliminated along with the possibility of falsehood and
contradiction. For it was argued that ‘nothing’ had no
existence and could not be an object of thought.<a id="FNanchor_71_71" href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></p>


<h3><a id="II-VI"></a>VI.</h3>

<p>From utter confusion to extreme nihilism there was but
a single step. This step was taken by Gorgias, the Sicilian
rhetorician, who held the same relation towards western
Hellas and the Eleatic school as that which Protagoras held
towards eastern Hellas and the philosophy of Heracleitus.
He, like his eminent contemporary, was opposed to the
thinkers whom, borrowing a useful term from the nomenclature
of the last century, we may call the Greek physiocrats.
To confute them, he wrote a book with the significant title,
<cite>On Nature or Nothing</cite>: maintaining, first, that nothing
exists; secondly, that if anything exists, we cannot know it;
thirdly, that if we know it, there is no possibility of communicating
our knowledge to others. The first thesis was established
by pushing the Eleatic arguments against movement
and change a little further; the second by showing that
thought and existence are different, or else everything that is
thought of would exist; the third by establishing a similar
incommensurability between words and sensations. Grote<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
has attempted to show that Gorgias was only arguing against
the existence of a noumenon underlying phenomena, such as
all idealists deny. Zeller has, however, convincingly proved
that Gorgias, in common with every other thinker before
Plato, was ignorant of this distinction;<a id="FNanchor_72_72" href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> and we may add
that it would leave the second and third theses absolutely
unimpaired. We must take the whole together as constituting
a declaration of war against science, an assertion, in
still stronger language, of the agnosticism taught by Protagoras.
The truth is, that a Greek controversialist generally
overproved his case, and in order to overwhelm an adversary
pulled down the whole house, even at the risk of being
buried among the ruins himself. A modern reasoner, taking
his cue from Gorgias, without pushing the matter to such an
extreme, might carry on his attack on lines running parallel
with those laid down by the Sicilian Sophist. He would
begin by denying the existence of a ‘state of Nature’; for
such a state must be either variable or constant. If it is
constant, how could civilisation ever have arisen? If it is
variable, what becomes of the fixed standard appealed to?
Then, again, supposing such a state ever to have existed,
how could authentic information about it have come down
to us through the ages of corruption which are supposed to
have intervened? And, lastly, granting that a state of Nature
accessible to enquiry has ever existed, how can we reorganise
society on the basis of such discordant data as are presented
to us by the physiocrats, no two of whom agree with regard
to the first principles of natural order; one saying that it is
equality, another aristocracy, and a third despotism? We do
not say that these arguments are conclusive, we only mean
that in relation to modern thought they very fairly represent
the dialectic artillery brought to bear by Greek humanism
against its naturalistic opponents.</p>

<p>We have seen how Prodicus and Hippias professed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
teach all science, all literature, and all virtuous accomplishments.
We have seen how Protagoras rejected every kind of
knowledge unconnected with social culture. We now find
Gorgias going a step further. In his later years, at least, he
professes to teach nothing but rhetoric or the art of persuasion.
We say in his later years, for at one time he seems to
have taught ethics and psychology as well.<a id="FNanchor_73_73" href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> But the Gorgias
of Plato’s famous dialogue limits himself to the power of producing
persuasion by words on all possible subjects, even
those of whose details he is ignorant. Wherever the rhetorician
comes into competition with the professional he will beat
him on his own ground, and will be preferred to him for every
public office. The type is by no means extinct, and flourishes
like a green bay-tree among ourselves. Like Pendennis, a
writer of this kind will review any book from the height of
superior knowledge acquired by two hours’ reading in the
British Museum; or, if he is adroit enough, will dispense with
even that slender amount of preparation. He need not even
trouble himself to read the book which he criticises. A
superficial acquaintance with magazine articles will qualify
him to pass judgment on all life, all religion, and all philosophy.
But it is in politics that the finest career lies before
him. He rises to power by attacking the measures of real
statesmen, and remains there by adopting them. He becomes
Chancellor of the Exchequer by gross economical blundering,
and Prime Minister by a happy mixture of epigram and
adulation.</p>

<p>Rhetoric conferred even greater power in old Athens than
in modern England. Not only did mastery of expression
lead to public employment; but also, as every citizen was
permitted by law to address his assembled fellow-countrymen
and propose measures for their acceptance, it became a direct
passport to supreme political authority. Nor was this all.
At Athens the employment of professional advocates was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
allowed, and it was easy to prosecute an enemy on the most
frivolous pretexts. If the defendant happened to be wealthy,
and if condemnation involved a loss of property, there was a
prejudice against him in the minds of the jury, confiscation
being regarded as a convenient resource for replenishing the
national exchequer. Thus the possession of rhetorical ability
became a formidable weapon in the hands of unscrupulous
citizens, who were enabled to extort large sums by the mere
threat of putting rich men on their trial for some real or
pretended offence. This systematic employment of rhetoric
for purposes of self-aggrandisement bore much the same relation
to the teaching of Protagoras and Gorgias as the open
and violent seizure of supreme power on the plea of natural
superiority bore to the theories of their rivals, being the way
in which practical men applied the principle that truth is determined
by persuasion. It was also attended by considerably
less danger than a frank appeal to the right of the stronger,
so far at least as the aristocratic party were concerned. For
they had been taught a lesson not easily forgotten by the
downfall of the oligarchies established in 411 and 404; and
the second catastrophe especially proved that nothing but a
popular government was possible in Athens. Accordingly,
the nobles set themselves to study new methods for obtaining
their ultimate end, which was always the possession of uncontrolled
power over the lives and fortunes of their fellow-citizens.
With wealth to purchase instruction from the
Sophists, with leisure to practise oratory, and with the
ability often accompanying high birth, there was no reason
why the successors of Charmides and Critias should not
enjoy all the pleasures of tyranny unaccompanied by any of
its drawbacks. Here, again, a parallel suggests itself
between ancient Greece and modern Europe. On the
Continent, where theories of natural law are far more
prevalent than with us, it is by brute force that justice is
trampled down: the one great object of every ambitious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
intriguer is to possess himself of the military machine, his
one great terror, that a stronger man may succeed in
wresting it from him; in England the political adventurer
looks to rhetoric as his only resource, and at the pinnacle of
power has to dread the hailstorm of epigrammatic invective
directed against him by abler or younger rivals.<a id="FNanchor_74_74" href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></p>

<p>Besides its influence on the formation and direction of
political eloquence, the doctrine professed by Protagoras had
a far-reaching effect on the subsequent development of
thought. Just as Cynicism was evolved from the theory of
Hippias, so also did the teaching which denied Nature and
concentrated all study on subjective phenomena, with a
tendency towards individualistic isolation, lead on to the
system of Aristippus. The founder of the Cyrenaic school is
called a Sophist by Aristotle, nor can the justice of the
appellation be doubted. He was, it is true, a friend and
companion of Socrates, but intellectually he is more nearly
related to Protagoras. Aristippus rejected physical studies,
reduced all knowledge to the consciousness of our own
sensations, and made immediate gratification the end of life.
Protagoras would have objected to the last principle, but it
was only an extension of his own views, for all history proves
that Hedonism is constantly associated with sensationalism.
The theory that knowledge is built up out of feelings has an
elective affinity for the theory that action is, or ought to be,
determined in the last resort by the most prominent feelings,
which are pleasure and pain. Both theories have since been
strengthened by the introduction of a new and more ideal
element into each. We have come to see that knowledge is
constituted not by sensations alone, but by sensations grouped
according to certain laws which seem to be inseparable from
the existence of any consciousness whatever. And, similarly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
we have learned to take into account, not merely the
momentary enjoyments of an individual, but his whole life’s
happiness as well, and not his happiness only, but also that
of the whole community to which he belongs. Nevertheless,
in both cases it is rightly held that the element of feeling
preponderates, and the doctrines of such thinkers as J. S. Mill
are legitimately traceable through Epicurus and Aristippus to
Protagoras as their first originator.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the importance of this impulse, it does
not represent the whole effect produced by Protagoras on
philosophy. His eristic method was taken up by the
Megaric school, and at first combined with other elements
borrowed from Parmenides and Socrates, but ultimately
extricated from them and used as a critical solvent of all
dogmatism by the later Sceptics. From their writings, after
a long interval of enforced silence, it passed over to
Montaigne, Bayle, Hume, and Kant, with what redoubtable
consequences to received opinions need not here be specified.
Our object is simply to illustrate the continuity of thought,
and the powerful influence exercised by ancient Greece on its
subsequent development.</p>

<p>Every variety of opinion current among the Sophists
reduces itself, in the last analysis, to their fundamental
antithesis between Nature and Law, the latter being somewhat
ambiguously conceived by its supporters as either
human reason or human will, or more generally as both
together, combining to assert their self-dependence and
emancipation from external authority. This antithesis was
prefigured in the distinction between Chthonian and Olympian
divinities. Continuing afterwards to inspire the rivalry of
opposing schools, Cynic against Cyrenaic, Stoic against
Epicurean, Sceptic against Dogmatist, it was but partially
overcome by the mediatorial schemes of Socrates and
his successors. Then came Catholicism, equally adverse
to the pretensions of either party, and held them down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
under its suffocating pressure for more than a thousand
years.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">‘Natur und Geist, so spricht man nicht zu Christen,</div>
  <div class="verse">Darum verbrennt man Atheisten;</div>
  <div class="verse">Natur ist Sünde, Geist ist Teufel.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Both slowly struggled back into consciousness in the fitful
dreams of mediaeval sleep. Nature was represented by
astrology with its fatalistic predetermination of events;
idealism by the alchemical lore which was to give its
possessor eternal youth and inexhaustible wealth. With the
complete revival of classic literature and the temporary
neutralisation of theology by internal discord, both sprang up
again in glorious life, and produced the great art of the
sixteenth century, the great science and philosophy of the
seventeenth. Later on, becoming self-conscious, they divide,
and their partisans draw off into two opposing armies,
Rousseau against Voltaire, Herder against Kant, Goethe
against Schiller, Hume against himself. Together they
bring about the Revolution; but after marching hand in hand
to the destruction of all existing institutions they again part
company, and, putting on the frippery of a dead faith,
confront one another, each with its own ritual, its own
acolytes, its own intolerance, with feasts of Nature and
goddesses of Reason, in mutual and murderous hostility.
When the storm subsided, new lines of demarcation were
laid down, and the cause of political liberty was dissociated
from what seemed to be thoroughly discredited figments.
Nevertheless, imaginative literature still preserves traces of
the old conflict, and on examining the four greatest English
novelists of the last fifty years we shall find that Dickens
and Charlotte Bronté, though personally most unlike, agree
in representing the arbitrary, subjective, ideal side of life, the
subjugation of things to self, not of self to things; he transfiguring
them in the light of humour, fancy, sentiment; she
transforming them by the alchemy of inward passion; while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
Thackeray and George Eliot represent the triumph of
natural forces over rebellious individualities; the one writer
depicting an often crude reality at odds with convention and
conceit; while the other, possessing, if not an intrinsically
greater genius, at least a higher philosophical culture, discloses
to us the primordial necessities of existence, the
pitiless conformations of circumstance, before which egoism,
ignorance, illusion, and indecision must bow, or be crushed
to pieces if they resist.</p>


<h3><a id="II-VII"></a>VII.</h3>

<p>Our readers have now before them everything of importance
that is known about the Sophists, and something more
that is not known for certain, but may, we think, be reasonably
conjectured. Taking the whole class together, they represent
a combination of three distinct tendencies, the endeavour
to supply an encyclopaedic training for youth, the cultivation
of political rhetoric as a special art, and the search after a
scientific foundation for ethics derived from the results of
previous philosophy. With regard to the last point, they
agree in drawing a fundamental distinction between Nature
and Law, but some take one and some the other for their
guide. The partisans of Nature lean to the side of a more
comprehensive education, while their opponents tend more
and more to lay an exclusive stress on oratorical proficiency.
Both schools are at last infected by the moral corruption of
the day, natural right becoming identified with the interest of
the stronger, and humanism leading to the denial of objective
reality, the substitution of illusion for knowledge, and the
confusion of momentary gratification with moral good. The
dialectical habit of considering every question under contradictory
aspects degenerates into eristic prize-fighting and deliberate
disregard of the conditions which alone make argument
possible. Finally, the component elements of Sophisti<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>cism
are dissociated from one another, and are either separately
developed or pass over into new combinations. Rhetoric,
apart from speculation, absorbs the whole time and talent of
an Isocrates; general culture is imparted by a professorial
class without originality, but without reproach; naturalism
and sensuous idealism are worked up into systematic completion
for the sake of their philosophical interest alone; and
the name of sophistry is unhappily fastened by Aristotle on
paid exhibitions of verbal wrangling which the great Sophists
would have regarded with indignation and disgust.</p>

<p>It remains for us to glance at the controversy which has
long been carried on respecting the true position of the
Sophists in Greek life and thought. We have already alluded
to the by no means favourable judgment passed on them by
some among their contemporaries. Socrates condemned
them severely,<span class="ref"><a href="#H">H</a></span> but only because they received payment for
their lessons; and the sentiment was probably echoed by
many who had neither his disinterestedness nor his frugality.
To make profit by intellectual work was not unusual in
Greece. Pheidias sold his statues; Pindar spent his life
writing for money; Simonides and Sophocles were charged
with showing too great eagerness in the pursuit of gain.<a id="FNanchor_75_75" href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a>
But a man’s conversation with his friends had always been
gratuitous, and the novel idea of charging a high fee for it
excited considerable offence. Socrates called it prostitution—the
sale of that which should be the free gift of love—without
perhaps sufficiently considering that the same privilege
had formerly been purchased with a more dishonourable
price. He also considered that a freeman was degraded by
placing himself at the beck and call of another, although it
would appear that the Sophists chose their own time for
lecturing, and were certainly not more slaves than a sculptor
or poet who had received an order to execute. It was also
argued that any one who really succeeded in improving the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
community benefited so much by the result that it was unfair
on his part to demand any additional remuneration. Suppose
a popular preacher were to come over from New York to
England, star about among the principal cities, charging a
high price for admission to his sermons, and finally return
home in possession of a handsome fortune, we can well
imagine that sarcasms at the expense of such profitable piety
would not be wanting. This hypothetical case will help us
to understand how many an honest Athenian must have felt
towards the showy colonial strangers who were making such
a lucrative business of teaching moderation and justice.
Plato, speaking for his master but not from his master’s
standpoint, raised an entirely different objection. He saw no
reason why the Sophists should not sell their wisdom if they
had any wisdom to sell. But this was precisely what he
denied. He submitted their pretensions to a searching cross-examination,
and, as he considered, convicted them of being
worthless pretenders. There was a certain unfairness about
this method, for neither his own positive teaching nor that of
Socrates could have stood before a similar test, as Aristotle
speedily demonstrated in the next generation. He was, in
fact, only doing for Protagoras and Gorgias what they had
done for early Greek speculation, and what every school
habitually does for its predecessors. It had yet to be learned
that this dissolving dialectic constitutes the very law of
philosophical progress. The discovery was made by Hegel,
and it is to him that the Sophists owe their rehabilitation in
modern times. His lectures on the History of Philosophy
contain much that was afterwards urged by Grote on the
same side. Five years before the appearance of Grote’s
famous sixty-seventh chapter, Lewes had also published a
vindication of the Sophists, possibly suggested by Hegel’s
work, which he had certainly consulted when preparing his
own History. There is, however, this great difference, that
while the two English critics endeavour to minimise the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
sceptical, innovating tendency of the Sophists, it is, contrariwise,
brought into exaggerated prominence by the German
philosopher. We have just remarked that the final dissolution
of Sophisticism was brought about by the separate
development given to each of the various tendencies which it
temporarily combined. Now, each of our three apologists
has taken up one of these tendencies, and treated it as constituting
the whole movement under discussion. To Hegel, the
Sophists are chiefly subjective idealists. To Lewes, they are
rhetoricians like Isocrates. To Grote, they are, what in truth
the Sophists of the Roman empire were, teachers representing
the standard opinions of their age. Lewes and Grote are
both particularly anxious to prove that the original Sophists
did not corrupt Greek morality. Thus much has been conceded
by contemporary German criticism, and is no more
than was observed by Plato long ago. Grote further asserts
that the implied corruption of morality is an illusion, and
that at the end of the Peloponnesian war the Athenians were
no worse than their forefathers who fought at Marathon. His
opinion is shared by so accomplished a scholar as Prof.
Jowett;<a id="FNanchor_76_76" href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> but here he has the combined authority of Thucydides,
Aristophanes, and Plato against him. We have, however,
examined this question already, and need not return to
it. Whether any of the Sophists themselves can be proved
to have taught immoral doctrines is another moot point.
Grote defends them all, Polus and Thrasymachus included.
Here, also, we have expressed our dissent from the eminent
historian, whom we can only suppose to have missed the
whole point of Plato’s argument. Lewes takes different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
ground when he accuses Plato of misrepresenting his opponents.
It is true that the Sophists cannot be heard in self-defence,
but there is no internal improbability about the
charges brought against them. The Greek rhetoricians are
not accused of saying anything that has not been said again
and again by their modern representatives. Whether the
odium of such sentiments should attach itself to the whole
class of Sophists is quite another question. Grote denies that
they held any doctrine in common. The German critics, on
the other hand, insist on treating them as a school with
common principles and tendencies. Brandis calls them ‘a
number of men, gifted indeed, but not seekers after knowledge
for its own sake, who made a trade of giving instruction as a
means for the attainment of external and selfish ends, and of
substituting mere technical proficiency for real science.’<a id="FNanchor_77_77" href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> If
our account be the true one, this would apply to Gorgias and
the younger rhetoricians alone. One does not precisely see
what external or selfish ends were subserved by the physical
philosophy which Prodicus and Hippias taught, nor why the
comprehensive enquiries of Protagoras into the conditions of
civilisation and the limits of human knowledge should be
contemptuously flung aside because he made them the basis
of an honourable profession. Zeller, in much the same strain,
defines a Sophist as one who professes to be a teacher of
wisdom, while his object is individual culture (die formelle und
praktische Bildung des Subjekts) and not the scientific investigation
of truth.<a id="FNanchor_78_78" href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> We do not know whether Grote was
content with an explanation which would only have required
an unimportant modification of his own statements to agree
precisely with them. It ought amply to have satisfied Lewes.
For ourselves, we must confess to caring very little whether
the Sophists investigated truth for its own sake or as a means
to self-culture. We believe, and in the next chapter we hope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
to show, that Socrates, at any rate, did not treat knowledge
apart from practice as an end in itself. But the history of
philosophy is not concerned with such subtleties as these.
Our contention is that the Stoic, Epicurean, and Sceptical
schools may be traced back through Antisthenes and Aristippus
to Hippias and Protagoras much more directly than
to Socrates. If Zeller will grant this, then he can no longer
treat Sophisticism as a mere solvent of the old physical philosophy.
If he denies it, we can only appeal to his own history,
which here, as well as in our discussions of early Greek
thought, we have found more useful than any other work on
the subject. Our obligations to Grote are of a more general
character. We have learned from him to look at the Sophists
without prejudice. But we think that he, too, underrates
their far-reaching intellectual significance, while his defence
of their moral orthodoxy seems, so far as certain members of
the class are concerned, inconsistent with any belief in Plato’s
historical fidelity. That the most eminent Sophists did
nothing to corrupt Greek morality is now almost universally
admitted. If we have succeeded in showing that they did
not corrupt but fruitfully develop Greek philosophy, the
purpose of this study will have been sufficiently fulfilled.</p>

<p>The title of this chapter may have seemed to promise more
than a casual mention of the thinker in whom Greek Humanism
attained its loftiest and purest expression. But in
history, no less than in life, Socrates must ever stand apart
from the Sophists. Beyond and above all specialities of
teaching, the transcendent dignity of a character which
personified philosophy itself demands a separate treatment.
Readers who have followed us thus far may feel interested in
an attempt to throw some new light on one who was a riddle
to his contemporaries, and has remained a riddle to after-ages.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a><br />

<small>THE PLACE OF SOCRATES IN GREEK PHILOSOPHY.</small></h2>


<h3><a id="III-I"></a>I.</h3>

<p>Apart from legendary reputations, there is no name in the
world’s history more famous than that of Socrates, and in the
history of philosophy there is none so famous. The only
thinker that approaches him in celebrity is his own disciple
Plato. Every one who has heard of Greece or Athens has
heard of him. Every one who has heard of him knows that
he was supremely good and great. Each successive generation
has confirmed the reputed Delphic oracle that no man
was wiser than Socrates. He, with one or two others, alone
came near to realising the ideal of a Stoic sage. Christians
deem it no irreverence to compare him with the Founder of
their religion. If a few dissentient voices have broken the
general unanimity, they have, whether consciously or not, been
inspired by the Socratic principle that we should let no
opinion pass unquestioned and unproved. Furthermore, it so
happens that this wonderful figure is known even to the multitude
by sight as well as by name. Busts, cameos, and
engravings have made all familiar with the Silenus-like physiognomy,
the thick lips, upturned nose, and prominent eyes
which impressed themselves so strangely on the imagination
of a race who are accused of having cared for nothing but
physical beauty, because they rightly regarded it as the natural
accompaniment of moral loveliness. Those who wish to discover
what manner of mind lay hid beneath this uninviting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
exterior may easily satisfy their curiosity, for Socrates is personally
better known than any other character of antiquity.
Dr. Johnson himself is not a more familiar figure to the
student of literature. Alone among classical worthies his
table-talk has been preserved for us, and the art of memoir-writing
seems to have been expressly created for his behoof.<a id="FNanchor_79_79" href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a>
We can follow him into all sorts of company and test his
behaviour in every variety of circumstances. He conversed
with all classes and on all subjects of human interest, with
artisans, artists, generals, statesmen, professors, and professional
beauties. We meet him in the armourer’s workshop, in the
sculptor’s studio, in the boudoirs of the <i lang="fr">demi-monde</i>, in the
banqueting-halls of flower-crowned and wine-flushed Athenian
youth, combining the self-mastery of an Antisthenes with the
plastic grace of an Aristippus; or, in graver moments, cheering
his comrades during the disastrous retreat from Delium;
upholding the sanctity of law, as President of the Assembly,
against a delirious populace; confronting with invincible
irony the oligarchic terrorists who held life and death in their
hands; pleading not for himself, but for reason and justice,
before a stupid and bigoted tribunal; and, in the last sad
scene of all, exchanging Attic courtesies with the unwilling
instrument of his death.<a id="FNanchor_80_80" href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></p>

<p>Such a character would, in any case, be remarkable; it
becomes of extraordinary, or rather of unique, interest when
we consider that Socrates could be and do so much, not in
spite of being a philosopher, but because he was a philosopher,
the chief though not the sole originator of a vast intellectual
revolution; one who, as a teacher, constituted the supremacy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
of reason, and as an individual made reason his sole guide in
life. He at once discovered new principles, popularised them
for the benefit of others, and exemplified them in his own
conduct; but he did not accomplish these results separately;
they were only different aspects of the same systematising
process which is identical with philosophy itself. Yet the
very success of Socrates in harmonising life and thought
makes it the more difficult for us to construct a complete picture
of his personality. Different observers have selected
from the complex combination that which best suited their own
mental predisposition, pushing out of sight the other elements
which, with him, served to correct and complete it. The very
popularity that has attached itself to his name is a proof of
this; for the multitude can seldom appreciate more than one
excellence at a time, nor is that usually of the highest order.
Hegel complains that Socrates has been made the patron-saint
of moral twaddle.<a id="FNanchor_81_81" href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> We are fifty years further removed
than Hegel from the golden age of platitude; the twaddle of
our own time is half cynical, half aesthetic, and wholly unmoral;
yet there are no signs of diminution in the popular
favour with which Socrates has always been regarded. The
man of the world, the wit, the <i lang="fr">viveur</i>, the enthusiastic admirer
of youthful beauty, the scornful critic of democracy is welcome
to many who have no taste for ethical discourses and fine-spun
arguments.</p>

<p>Nor is it only the personality of Socrates that has been so
variously conceived; his philosophy, so far as it can be separated
from his life, has equally given occasion to conflicting
interpretations, and it has even been denied that he had, properly
speaking, any philosophy at all. These divergent presentations
of his teaching, if teaching it can be called, begin
with the two disciples to whom our knowledge of it is almost
entirely due. There is, curiously enough, much the same
inner discrepancy between Xenophon’s <cite>Memorabilia</cite> and those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
Platonic dialogues where Socrates is the principal spokesman,
as that which distinguishes the Synoptic from the Johannine
Gospels. The one gives us a report certainly authentic, but
probably incomplete; the other account is, beyond all doubt,
a highly idealised portraiture, but seems to contain some
traits directly copied from the original, which may well have
escaped a less philosophical observer than Plato. Aristotle
also furnishes us with some scanty notices which are of use
in deciding between the two rival versions, although we
cannot be sure that he had access to any better sources of
information than are open to ourselves. By variously combining
and reasoning from these data modern critics have
produced a third Socrates, who is often little more than
the embodiment of their own favourite opinions.</p>

<p>In England, the most generally accepted method seems
to be that followed by Grote. This consists in taking the
Platonic <cite>Apologia</cite> as a sufficiently faithful report of the
defence actually made by Socrates on his trial, and piecing
it on to the details supplied by Xenophon, or at least to as
many of them as can be made to fit, without too obvious an
accommodation of their meaning. If, however, we ask on
what grounds a greater historical credibility is attributed to
the <cite>Apologia</cite> than to the <cite>Republic</cite> or the <cite>Phaedo</cite>, none can be
offered except the seemingly transparent truthfulness of the
narrative itself, an argument which will not weigh much with
those who remember how brilliant was Plato’s talent for
fiction, and how unscrupulously it could be employed for
purposes of edification. The <cite>Phaedo</cite> puts an autobiographical
statement into the mouth of Socrates which we only
know to be imaginary because it involves the acceptance of
a theory unknown to the real Socrates. Why, then, may
not Plato have thought proper to introduce equally fictitious
details into the speech delivered by his master before the
dicastery, if, indeed, the speech, as we have it, be not a fancy
composition from beginning to end?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span></p>

<p>Before we can come to a decision on this point it will be
necessary briefly to recapitulate the statements in question.
Socrates is defending himself against a capital charge. He
fears that a prejudice respecting him may exist in the minds
of the jury, and tries to explain how it arose without any
fault of his, as follows:—A certain friend of his had asked
the oracle at Delphi whether there was any man wiser than
Socrates? The answer was that no man was wiser. Not
being conscious of possessing any wisdom, great or small, he
felt considerably surprised on hearing of this declaration, and
thought to convince the god of falsehood by finding out some
one wiser than himself. He first went to an eminent politician,
who, however, proved, on examination, to be utterly
ignorant, with the further disadvantage that it was impossible
to convince him of his ignorance. On applying the same test
to others a precisely similar result was obtained. It was
only the handicraftsmen who could give a satisfactory account
of themselves, and their knowledge of one trade made them
fancy that they understood everything else equally well.
Thus the meaning of the oracle was shown to be that God
alone is truly wise, and that of all men he is wisest who,
like Socrates, perceives that human wisdom is worth little or
nothing. Ever since then, Socrates has made it his business
to vindicate the divine veracity by seeking out and exposing
every pretender to knowledge that he can find, a line
of conduct which has made him extremely unpopular
in Athens, while it has also won him a great reputation
for wisdom, as people supposed that the matters on which
he convicted others of ignorance were perfectly clear to
himself.</p>

<p>The first difficulty that strikes one in connexion with this
extraordinary story arises out of the oracle on which it all
hinges. Had such a declaration been really made by the
Pythia, would not Xenophon have eagerly quoted it as a
proof of the high favour in which his hero stood with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
gods?<a id="FNanchor_82_82" href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> And how could Socrates have acquired so great a
reputation before entering on the cross-examining career
which alone made him conscious of any superiority over
other men, and had alone won the admiration of his fellow-citizens?
Our doubts are still further strengthened when we
find that the historical Socrates did not by any means profess
the sweeping scepticism attributed to him by Plato. So far
from believing that ignorance was the common and necessary
lot of all mankind, himself included, he held that action
should, so far as possible, be entirely guided by knowledge;<a id="FNanchor_83_83" href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a>
that the man who did not always know what he was about
resembled a slave; that the various virtues were only different
forms of knowledge; that he himself possessed this
knowledge, and was perfectly competent to share it with his
friends. We do, indeed, find him very ready to convince
ignorant and presumptuous persons of their deficiencies, but
only that he may lead them, if well disposed, into the path
of right understanding. He also thought that there were
certain secrets which would remain for ever inaccessible to
the human intellect, facts connected with the structure of the
universe which the gods had reserved for their own exclusive
cognisance. This, however, was, according to him, a kind
of knowledge which, even if it could be obtained, would not
be particularly worth having, and the search after which
would leave us no leisure for more useful acquisitions. Nor
does the Platonic Socrates seem to have been at the trouble
of arguing against natural science. The subjects of his
elenchus are the professors of such arts as politics, rhetoric,
and poetry. Further, we have something stronger than a
simple inference from the facts recorded by Xenophon; we
have his express testimony to the fact that Socrates did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
limit himself to confuting people who fancied they knew
everything; here we must either have a direct reference to
the <cite>Apologia</cite>, or to a theory identical with that which it
embodies.<span class="ref"><a href="#A-I">I</a></span> Some stress has been laid on a phrase quoted by
Xenophon himself as having been used by Hippias, which at
first sight seems to support Plato’s view. The Elian Sophist
charges Socrates with practising a continual irony, refuting
others and not submitting to be questioned himself;<a id="FNanchor_84_84" href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> an
accusation which, we may observe in passing, is not borne
out by the discussion that subsequently takes place between
them. Here, however, we must remember that Socrates used
to convey instruction under the form of a series of leading
questions, the answers to which showed that his interlocutor
understood and assented to the doctrine propounded. Such
a method might easily give rise to the misconception that he
refused to disclose his own particular opinions, and contented
himself with eliciting those held by others. Finally, it is to be
noted that the idea of fulfilling a religious mission, or exposing
human ignorance <i lang="la">ad majorem Dei gloriam</i>, on which Grote
lays such stress, has no place in Xenophon’s conception of his
master, although, had such an idea been really present, one
can hardly imagine how it could have been passed over by a
writer with whom piety amounted to superstition. It is, on
the other hand, an idea which would naturally occur to a
great religious reformer who proposed to base his reconstruction
of society on faith in a supernatural order, and the desire
to realise it here below.</p>

<p>So far we have contrasted the <cite>Apologia</cite> with the <cite>Memorabilia</cite>.
We have now to consider in what relation it stands to
Plato’s other writings. The constructive dogmatic Socrates,
who is a principal spokesman in some of them, differs widely
from the sceptical Socrates of the famous <cite>Defence</cite>, and the
difference has been urged as an argument for the historical
authenticity of the latter.<a id="FNanchor_85_85" href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> Plato, it is implied, would not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
have departed so far from his usual conception of the sage,
had he not been desirous of reproducing the actual words
spoken on so solemn an occasion. There are, however,
several dialogues which seem to have been composed for the
express purpose of illustrating the negative method supposed
to have been described by Socrates to his judges, investigations
the sole result of which is to upset the theories of
other thinkers, or to show that ordinary men act without
being able to assign a reason for their conduct. Even the
<cite>Republic</cite> is professedly tentative in its procedure, and only
follows out a train of thought which has presented itself
almost by accident to the company. Unlike Charles Lamb’s
Scotchman, the leading spokesman does not bring, but find,
and you are invited to cry halves to whatever turns up in his
company.</p>

<p>Plato had, in truth, a conception of science which no
knowledge then attained—perhaps one may add, no knowledge
ever attainable—could completely satisfy. Even the rigour
of mathematical demonstration did not content him, for
mathematical truth itself rested on unproved assumptions, as
we also, by the way, have lately discovered. Perhaps the
Hegelian system would have fulfilled his requirements;
perhaps not even that. Moreover, that the new order which
he contemplated might be established, it was necessary to
begin by making a clean sweep of all existing opinions.
With the urbanity of an Athenian, the piety of a disciple, and
the instinct of a great dramatic artist, he preferred to assume
that this indispensable task had already been done by another.
And of all preceding thinkers, who was so well qualified for
the undertaking as Socrates? Who else had wielded the
weapons of negative dialectic with such consummate dexterity?
Who had assumed such a critical attitude towards
the beliefs of his contemporaries? Who had been so anxious
to find a point of attachment for every new truth in the minds
of his interlocutors? Who therefore could, with such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
plausibility, be put forward in the guise of one who laid claim
to no wisdom on his own account? The son of Phaenaretê
seemed made to be the Baptist of a Greek Messiah; but Plato,
in treating him as such, has drawn a discreet veil over the
whole positive side of his predecessor’s teaching, and to
discover what this was we must place ourselves under the
guidance of Xenophon’s more faithful report.</p>

<p>Not that Xenophon is to be taken as a perfectly accurate
exponent of the Socratic philosophy. His work, it must be
remembered, was primarily intended to vindicate Socrates
from a charge of impiety and immoral teaching, not to
expound a system which he was perhaps incompetent to
appreciate or understand. We are bound to accept everything
that he relates; we are bound to include nothing that
he does not relate; but we may fairly readjust the proportions
of his sketch. It is here that a judicious use of Plato will
furnish us with the most valuable assistance. He grasped
Socratism in all its parts and developed it in all directions, so
that by following back the lines of his system to their origin
we shall be put on the proper track and shall know where to
look for the suggestions which were destined to be so magnificently
worked out.<a id="FNanchor_86_86" href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span></p>


<h3><a id="III-II"></a>II.</h3>

<p>Before entering on our task of reconstruction, we must
turn aside to consider with what success the same enterprise
has been attempted by modern German criticism, especially
by its chief contemporary representative, the last and
most distinguished historian of Greek philosophy. The
result at which Zeller, following Schleiermacher, arrives is
that the great achievement of Socrates was to put forward an
adequate idea of knowledge; in other words, to show what
true science ought to be, and what, as yet, it had never been,
with the addition of a demand that all action should be
based on such a scientific knowledge as its only sure foundation.<a id="FNanchor_87_87" href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">87</a>
To know a thing was to know its essence, its concept,
the assemblage of qualities which together constitute its definition,
and make it to be what it is. Former thinkers had
also sought for knowledge, but not <em>as</em> knowledge, not with a
clear notion of what it was that they really wanted. Socrates,
on the other hand, required that men should always be prepared
to give a strict account of the end which they had in
view, and of the means by which they hoped to gain it.
Further, it had been customary to single out for exclusive
attention that quality of an object by which the observer
happened to be most strongly impressed, passing over all
the others; the consequence of which was that the philosophers
had taken a one-sided view of facts, with the result of
falling into hopeless disagreement among themselves; the
Sophists had turned these contradictory points of view
against one another, and thus effected their mutual destruction;
while the dissolution of objective certainty had led to
a corresponding dissolution of moral truth. Socrates accepts
the Sophistic scepticism so far as it applies to the existing
state of science, but does not push it to the same fatal con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>clusion;
he grants that current beliefs should be thoroughly
sifted and, if necessary, discarded, but only that more solid
convictions may be substituted for them. Here a place is
found for his method of self-examination, and for the self-conscious
ignorance attributed to him by Plato. Comparing
his notions on particular subjects with his idea of what knowledge
in general ought to be, he finds that they do not satisfy
it; he knows that he knows nothing. He then has recourse
to other men who declare that they possess the knowledge of
which he is in search, but their pretended certainty vanishes
under the application of his dialectic test. This is the
famous Socratic irony. Finally, he attempts to come at real
knowledge, that is to say, the construction of definitions, by
employing that inductive method with the invention of which
he is credited by Aristotle. This method consists in bringing
together a number of simple and familiar examples from
common experience, generalising from them, and correcting
the generalisations by comparison with negative instances.
The reasons that led Socrates to restrict his enquiries to
human interests are rather lightly passed over by Zeller; he
seems at a loss how to reconcile the alleged reform of scientific
method with the complete abandonment of those
physical investigations which, we are told, had suffered so
severely from being cultivated on a different system.</p>

<p>There seem to be three principal points aimed at in the
very ingenious theory which we have endeavoured to summarise
as adequately as space would permit. Zeller apparently
wishes to bring Socrates into line with the great
tradition of early Greek thought, to distinguish him markedly
from the Sophists, and to trace back to his initiative the
intellectual method of Plato and Aristotle. We cannot
admit that the threefold attempt has succeeded. It seems to
us that a picture into which so much Platonic colouring has
been thrown would for that reason alone, and without any
further objection, be open to very grave suspicion. But even
accepting the historical accuracy of everything that Plato has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
said, or of as much as may be required, our critic’s inferences
are not justified by his authorities. Neither the Xenophontic
nor the Platonic Socrates seeks knowledge for its own sake,
nor does either of them offer a satisfactory definition of
knowledge, or, indeed, any definition at all. Aristotle was
the first to explain what science meant, and he did so, not by
developing the Socratic notion, but by incorporating it with
the other methods independently struck out by physical
philosophy. What would science be without the study of
causation? and was not this ostentatiously neglected by the
founder of conceptualism? Again, Plato, in the <cite>Theaetêtus</cite>,
makes his Socrates criticise various theories of knowledge,
but does not even hint that the critic had himself a better
theory than any of them in reserve. The author of the
<cite>Phaedo</cite> and the <cite>Republic</cite> was less interested in reforming the
methods of scientific investigation than in directing research
towards that which he believed to be alone worth knowing,
the eternal ideas which underlie phenomena. The historical
Socrates had no suspicion of transcendental realities; but he
thought that a knowledge of physics was unattainable, and
would be worthless if attained. By knowledge he meant art
rather than science, and his method of defining was intended
not for the latter but for the former. Those, he said, who can
clearly express what they want to do are best secured against
failure, and best able to communicate their skill to others.
He made out that the various virtues were different kinds of
knowledge, not from any extraordinary opinion of its preciousness,
but because he thought that knowledge was the
variable element in volition and that everything else was constant.
Zeller dwells strongly on the Socratic identification of
cognition with conduct; but how could anyone who fell at the
first step into such a confusion of ideas be fitted either to explain
what science meant or to come forward as the reformer
of its methods? Nor is it correct to say that Socrates
approached an object from every point of view, and took note
of all its characteristic qualities. On the contrary, one would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
be inclined to charge him with the opposite tendency, with
fixing his gaze too exclusively on some one quality, that to
him, as a teacher, was the most interesting. His identification
of virtue with knowledge is an excellent instance of this
habit. So also is his identification of beauty with serviceableness,
and his general disposition to judge of everything
by a rather narrow standard of utility. On the other hand,
Greek physical speculation would have gained nothing by a
minute attention to definitions, and most probably would have
been mischievously hampered by it. Aristotle, at any rate,
prefers the method of Democritus to the method of Plato;
and Aristotle himself is much nearer the truth when he
follows on the Ionian or Sicilian track than when he attempts
to define what in the then existing state of knowledge could
not be satisfactorily defined. To talk about the various
elements—earth, air, fire, and water—as things with which
everybody was already familiar, may have been a crude unscientific
procedure; to analyse them into different combinations
of the hot and the cold, the light and the heavy, the dry
and the moist, was not only erroneous but fatally misleading;
it was arresting enquiry, and doing precisely what the Sophists
had been accused of doing, that is, substituting the conceit for
the reality of wisdom. It was, no doubt, necessary that mathematical
terms should be defined; but where are we told that
geometricians had to learn this truth from Socrates? The
sciences of quantity, which could hardly have advanced a
step without the help of exact conceptions, were successfully
cultivated before he was born, and his influence was used to
discourage rather than to promote their accurate study. With
regard to the comprehensive all-sided examination of objects
on which Zeller lays so much stress, and which he seems to
regard as something peculiar to the conceptual method, it
had unquestionably been neglected by Parmenides and
Heracleitus; but had not the deficiency been already made
good by their immediate successors? What else is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
philosophy of Empedocles, the Atomists, and Anaxagoras,
but an attempt—we must add, a by no means unsuccessful
attempt—to recombine the opposing aspects of Nature which
had been too exclusively insisted on at Ephesus and Elea?
Again, to say that the Sophists had destroyed physical speculation
by setting these partial aspects of truth against one
another is, in our opinion, equally erroneous. First of all,
Zeller here falls into the old mistake, long ago corrected by
Grote, of treating the class in question as if they all held
similar views. We have shown in the preceding chapter, if
indeed it required to be shown, that the Sophists were
divided into two principal schools, of which one was devoted
to the cultivation of physics. Protagoras and Gorgias were
the only sceptics; and it was not by setting one theory
against another, but by working out a single theory to its last
consequences, that their scepticism was reached; with no
more effect, be it observed, than was exercised by Pyrrho on
the science of his day. For the two great thinkers, with the
aid of whose conclusions it was attempted to discredit objective
reality, were already left far behind at the close of the
fifth century; and neither their reasonings nor reasonings
based on theirs, could exercise much influence on a generation
which had Anaxagoras on Nature and the encyclopaedia
of Democritus in its hands. There was, however, one
critic who really did what the Sophists are charged with
doing; who derided and denounced physical science on the
ground that its professors were hopelessly at issue with one
another; and this critic was no other than Socrates himself.
He maintained, on purely popular and superficial grounds,
the same sceptical attitude to which Protagoras gave at least
the semblance of a psychological justification. And he
wished that attention should be concentrated on the very
subjects which Protagoras undertook to teach—namely,
ethics, politics, and dialectics. Once more, to say that
Socrates was conscious of not coming up to his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
standard of true knowledge is inconsistent with Xenophon’s
account, where he is represented as quite ready to answer
every question put to him, and to offer a definition of
everything that he considered worth defining. His scepticism,
if it ever existed, was as artificial and short-lived as
the scepticism of Descartes.</p>

<p>The truth is that no man who philosophised at all was
ever more free from tormenting doubts and self-questionings;
no man was ever more thoroughly satisfied with himself than
Socrates. Let us add that, from a Hellenic point of view, no
man had ever more reason for self-satisfaction. None, he
observed in his last days, had ever lived a better or a happier
life. Naturally possessed of a powerful constitution, he had
so strengthened it by habitual moderation and constant training
that up to the hour of his death, at the age of seventy, he
enjoyed perfect bodily and mental health. Neither hardship
nor exposure, neither abstinence nor indulgence in what to
other men would have been excess, could make any impression
on that adamantine frame. We know not how much truth
there may be in the story that, at one time, he was remarkable
for the violence of his passions; at any rate, when our
principal informants knew him he was conspicuous for the ease
with which he resisted temptation, and for the imperturbable
sweetness of his temper. His wants, being systematically
reduced to a minimum, were easily satisfied, and his cheerfulness
never failed. He enjoyed Athenian society so much that
nothing but military duty could draw him away from it. For
Socrates was a veteran who had served through three arduous
campaigns, and could give lectures on the duties of a general,
which so high an authority as Xenophon thought worth reporting.
He seems to have been on excellent terms with his
fellow-citizens, never having been engaged in a lawsuit, either
as plaintiff or defendant, until the fatal prosecution which
brought his career to a close. He could, on that occasion,
refuse to prepare a defence, proudly observing that his whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
life had been a preparation, that no man had ever seen him
commit an unjust or impious deed. The anguished cries of
doubt uttered by Italian and Sicilian thinkers could have no
meaning for one who, on principle, abstained from ontological
speculations; the uncertainty of human destiny which hung
like a thunder-cloud over Pindar and the tragic poets had
melted away under the sunshine of arguments, demonstrating,
to his satisfaction, the reality and beneficence of a supernatural
Providence. For he believed that the gods would
afford guidance in doubtful conjunctures to all who approached
their oracles in a reverent spirit; while, over and above the
Divine counsels accessible to all men, he was personally
attended by an oracular voice, a mysterious monitor, which
told him what to avoid, though not what to do, a circumstance
well worthy of note, for it shows that he did not, like Plato,
attribute every kind of right action to divine inspiration.</p>

<p>It may be said that all this only proves Socrates to have
been, in his own estimation, a good and happy, but not necessarily
a wise man. With him, however, the last of these conditions
was inseparable from the other two. He was prepared
to demonstrate, step by step, that his conduct was regulated
by fixed and ascertainable principles, and was of the kind
best adapted to secure happiness both for himself and for
others. That there were deficiencies in his ethical theory
may readily be admitted. The idea of universal beneficence
seems never to have dawned on his horizon; and chastity was
to him what sobriety is to us, mainly a self-regarding virtue.
We do not find that he ever recommended conjugal fidelity
to husbands; he regarded prostitution very much as it is still,
unhappily, regarded by men of the world among ourselves;
and in opposing the darker vices of his countrymen, it was
the excess rather than the perversion of appetite which he
condemned. These, however, are points which do not interfere
with our general contention that Socrates adopted the
ethical standard of his time, that he adopted it on rational<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
grounds, that having adopted he acted up to it, and that in so
reasoning and acting he satisfied his own ideal of absolute
wisdom.</p>

<p>Even as regards physical phenomena, Socrates, so far from
professing complete ignorance, held a very positive theory
which he was quite ready to share with his friends. He
taught what is called the doctrine of final causes; and, so far
as our knowledge goes, he was either the first to teach it, or,
at any rate, the first to prove the existence of divine agencies
by its means. The old poets had occasionally attributed the
origin of man and other animals to supernatural intelligence,
but, apparently, without being led to their conviction by any
evidence of design displayed in the structure of organised
creatures. Socrates, on the other hand, went through the
various external organs of the human body with great minuteness,
and showed, to his own satisfaction, that they evinced
the workings of a wise and beneficent Artist. We shall have
more to say further on about this whole argument; here we
only wish to observe that, intrinsically, it does not differ very
much from the speculations which its author derided as the
fruit of an impertinent curiosity; and that no one who now
employed it would, for a single moment, be called an agnostic
or a sceptic.</p>

<p>Must we, then, conclude that Socrates was, after all, nothing
but a sort of glorified Greek Paley, whose principal achievement
was to present the popular ideas of his time on morals
and politics under the form of a rather grovelling utilitarianism;
and whose ‘evidences of natural and revealed religion’ bore
much the same relation to Greek mythology as the corresponding
lucubrations of the worthy archdeacon bore to
Christian theology? Even were this the whole truth, it
should be remembered that there was an interval of twenty-three
centuries between the two teachers, which ought to be
taken due account of in estimating their relative importance.
Socrates, with his closely-reasoned, vividly-illustrated ethical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
expositions, had gained a tactical advantage over the vague
declamations of Gnomic poetry and the isolated aphorisms
of the Seven Sages, comparable to that possessed by Xenophon
and his Ten Thousand in dealing with the unwieldy masses
of Persian infantry and the undisciplined mountaineers of
Carduchia; while his idea of a uniformly beneficent Creator
marked a still greater advance on the jealous divinities of
Herodotus. On the other hand, as against Hume and Bentham,
Paley’s pseudo-scientific paraphernalia were like the
muskets and cannon of an Asiatic army when confronted by
the English conquerors of India. Yet had Socrates done no
more than contributed to philosophy the idea just alluded to,
his place in the evolution of thought, though honourable,
would not have been what it is justly held to be—unique.</p>


<h3><a id="III-III"></a>III.</h3>

<p>So far we have been occupied in disputing the views of
others; it is now time that our own view should be stated.
We maintain, then, that Socrates first brought out the idea,
not of knowledge, but of mind in its full significance; that he
first studied the whole circle of human interests as affected by
mind; that, in creating dialectics, he gave this study its proper
method, and simultaneously gave his method the only subject-matter
on which it could be profitably exercised; finally, that
by these immortal achievements philosophy was constituted,
and received a threefold verification—first, from the life of its
founder; secondly, from the success with which his spirit was
communicated to a band of followers; thirdly, from the whole
subsequent history of thought. Before substantiating these
assertions point by point, it will be expedient to glance at the
external influences which may be supposed to have moulded
the great intellect and the great character now under consideration.</p>

<p>Socrates was, before all things, an Athenian. To under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>stand
him we must first understand what the Athenian
character was in itself and independently of disturbing circumstances.
Our estimate of that character is too apt to be
biassed by the totally exceptional position which Athens
occupied during the fifth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> The possession of
empire developed qualities in her children which they had
not exhibited at an earlier period, and which they ceased to
exhibit when empire had been lost. Among these must be
reckoned military genius, an adventurous and romantic spirit,
and a high capacity for poetical and artistic production—qualities
displayed, it is true, by every Greek race, but by
some for a longer and by others for a shorter period. Now,
the tradition of greatness does not seem to have gone very
far back with Athens. Her legendary history, what we have
of it, is singularly unexciting. The same rather monotonous
though edifying story of shelter accorded to persecuted
fugitives, of successful resistance to foreign invasions, and of
devoted self-sacrifice to the State, meets us again and again.
The Attic drama itself shows how much more stirring was
the legendary lore of other tribes. One need only look at the
few remaining pieces which treat of patriotic subjects to
appreciate the difference; and an English reader may easily
convince himself of it by comparing Mr. Swinburne’s <cite>Erechtheus</cite>
with the same author’s <cite>Atalanta</cite>. There is a want of
vivid individuality perceptible all through. Even Theseus,
the great national hero, strikes one as a rather tame sort of
personage compared with Perseus, Heraclês, and Jason. No
Athenian figures prominently in the <cite>Iliad</cite>; and on the only
two occasions when Pindar was employed to commemorate
an Athenian victory at the Panhellenic games, he seems
unable to associate it with any legendary glories in the past.
The circumstances which for a long time made Attic history
so barren of incident are the same to which its subsequent
importance is due. The relation in which Attica stood to
the rest of Greece was somewhat similar to the relation in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
which Tuscany, long afterwards, stood to the rest of Italy.
It was the region least disturbed by foreign immigration, and
therefore became the seat of a slower but steadier mental
development. It was among those to whom war, revolution,
colonisation, and commerce brought the most many-sided
experience that intellectual activity was most speedily
ripened. Literature, art, and science were cultivated with
extraordinary success by the Greek cities of Asia Minor, and
even in some parts of the old country, before Athens had a
single man of genius, except Solon, to boast of. But along
with the enjoyment of undisturbed tranquillity, habits of self-government,
orderliness, and reasonable reflection were establishing
themselves, which finally enabled her to inherit all
that her predecessors in the race had accomplished, and to
add, what alone they still wanted, the crowning consecration
of self-conscious mind. There had, simultaneously, been
growing up an intensely patriotic sentiment, due, in part, to
the long-continued independence of Attica; in part, also, we
may suppose, to the union, at a very early period, of her
different townships into a single city. The same causes had,
however, also favoured a certain love of comfort, a jovial
pleasure-seeking disposition often degenerating into coarse
sensuality, a thriftiness, and an inclination to grasp at any
source of profit, coupled with extreme credulity where hopes
of profit were excited, together forming an element of prose-comedy
which mingles strangely with the tragic grandeur of
Athens in her imperial age, and emerges into greater prominence
after her fall, until it becomes the predominant characteristic
of her later days. It is, we may observe, the contrast
between these two aspects of Athenian life which gives the
plays of Aristophanes their unparalleled comic effect, and it
is their very awkward conjunction which makes Euripides so
unequal and disappointing a poet. We find, then, that the
original Athenian character is marked by reasonable reflection,
by patriotism, and by a tendency towards self-seeking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
materialism. Let us take note of these three qualities, for
we shall meet with them again in the philosophy of Socrates.</p>

<p>Empire, when it came to Athens, came almost unsought.
The Persian invasions had made her a great naval power;
the free choice of her allies placed her at the head of a great
maritime confederacy. The sudden command of vast resources
and the tension accumulated during ages of repose,
stimulated all her faculties into preternatural activity. Her
spirit was steeled almost to the Dorian temper, and entered
into victorious rivalry with the Dorian Muse. Not only did
her fleet sweep the sea, but her army, for once, defeated
Theban hoplites in the field. The grand choral harmonies of
Sicilian song, the Sicyonian recitals of epic adventure, were
rolled back into a framework for the spectacle of individual
souls meeting one another in argument, expostulation, entreaty,
and defiance; a nobler Doric edifice rose to confront
the Aeginetan temple of Athênê; the strained energy of
Aeginetan combatants was relaxed into attitudes of reposing
power, and the eternal smile on their faces was deepened into
the sadness of unfathomable thought. But to the violet-crowned
city, Athênê was a giver of wealth and wisdom
rather than of prowess; her empire rested on the contributions
of unwilling allies, and on a technical proficiency which others
were sure to equal in time; so that the Corinthian orators
could say with justice that Athenian skill was more easily
acquired than Dorian valour. At once receptive and communicative,
Athens absorbed all that Greece could teach her,
and then returned it in a more elaborate form, but without
the freshness of its earliest inspiration. Yet there was one
field that still afforded scope for creative originality. Habits
of analysis, though fatal to spontaneous production, were
favourable, or rather were necessary, to the growth of a new
philosophy. After the exhaustion of every limited idealism,
there remained that highest idealisation which is the reduction
of all past experience to a method available for the guidance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
of all future action. To accomplish this last enterprise it
was necessary that a single individual should gather up in
himself the spirit diffused through a whole people, bestowing
on it by that very concentration the capability of an infinitely
wider extension when its provisional representative should
have passed away from the scene.</p>

<p>Socrates represents the popular Athenian character much
as Richardson, in a different sphere, represents the English
middle-class character—represents it, that is to say, elevated
into transcendent genius. Except this elevation, there was
nothing anomalous about him. If he was exclusively
critical, rationalising, unadventurous, prosaic; in a word, as
the German historians say, something of a Philistine; so, we
may suspect, were the mass of his countrymen. His illustrations
were taken from such plebeian employments as
cattle-breeding, cobbling, weaving, and sailoring. These
were his ‘touches of things common’ which at last ‘rose to
touch the spheres.’ He both practised and inculcated
virtues, the value of which is especially evident in humble
life—frugality and endurance. But he also represents the
Dêmos in its sovereign capacity as legislator and judge.
Without aspiring to be an orator or statesman, he reserves
the ultimate power of arbitration and election. He submits
candidates for office to a severe scrutiny, and demands from
all men an even stricter account of their lives than retiring
magistrates had to give of their conduct, when in power, to
the people. He applies the judicial method of cross-examination
to the detection of error, and the parliamentary method
of joint deliberation to the discovery of truth. He follows
out the democratic principles of free speech and self-government,
by submitting every question that arises to public
discussion, and insisting on no conclusion that does not
command the willing assent of his audience. Finally, his
conversation, popular in form, was popular also in this
respect, that everybody who chose to listen might have the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
benefit of it gratuitously. Here we have a great change
from the scornful dogmatism of Heracleitus, and the
virtually oligarchic exclusiveness of the teachers who demanded
high fees for their instruction.</p>

<p>To be free and to rule over freemen were, with Socrates,
as with every Athenian, the goals of ambition, only his
freedom meant absolute immunity from the control of
passion or habit; government meant superior knowledge,
and government of freemen meant the power of producing
intellectual conviction. In his eyes, the possessor of any
art was, so far, a ruler, and the only true ruler, being obeyed
under severe penalties by all who stood in need of his skill.
But the royal art which he himself exercised, without
expressly laying claim to it, was that which assigns its proper
sphere to every other art, and provides each individual with
the employment which his peculiar faculties demand. This
is Athenian liberty and Athenian imperialism carried into
education, but so idealised and purified that they can hardly
be recognised at first sight.</p>

<p>The philosophy of Socrates is more obviously related to
the practical and religious tendencies of his countrymen.
Neither he nor they had any sympathy with the cosmological
speculations which seemed to be unconnected with human
interests, and to trench on matters beyond the reach of
human knowledge. The old Attic sentiment was averse
from adventures of any kind, whether political or intellectual.
Yet the new spirit of enquiry awakened by Ionian thought
could not fail to react powerfully on the most intelligent
man among the most intelligent people of Hellas. Above
all, one paramount idea which went beyond the confines of
the old philosophy had been evolved by the differentiation
of knowledge from its object, and had been presented,
although under a materialising form, by Anaxagoras to the
Athenian public. Socrates took up this idea, which expressed
what was highest and most distinctive in the national<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
character, and applied it to the development of ethical
speculation. We have seen, in the last chapter, how an
attempt was made to base moral truth on the results of
natural philosophy, and how that attempt was combated by
the Humanistic school. It could not be doubtful which side
Socrates would take in this controversy. That he paid any
attention to the teaching of Protagoras and Gorgias is,
indeed, highly problematic, for their names are never
mentioned by Xenophon, and the Platonic dialogues in which
they figure are evidently fictitious. Nevertheless, he had to
a certain extent arrived at the same conclusion with them,
although by a different path. He was opposed, on religious
grounds, to the theories which an acute psychological analysis
had led them to reject. Accordingly, the idea of Nature is
almost entirely absent from his conversation, and, like Protagoras,
he is guided solely by regard for human interests. To
the objection that positive laws were always changing, he
victoriously replied that it was because they were undergoing
an incessant adaptation to varying needs.<a id="FNanchor_88_88" href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> Like Protagoras,
again, he was a habitual student of old Greek literature, and
sedulously sought out the practical lessons in which it
abounded. To him, as to the early poets and sages,
Sôphrosynê, or self-knowledge and self-command taken
together, was the first and most necessary of all virtues.
Unlike them, however, he does not simply accept it from
tradition, but gives it a philosophical foundation—the newly-established
distinction between mind and body; a distinction
not to be confounded with the old Psychism, although Plato,
for his reforming purposes, shortly afterwards linked the two
together. The disembodied spirit of mythology was a mere
shadow or memory, equally destitute of solidity and of
understanding; with Socrates, mind meant the personal
consciousness which retains its continuous identity through
every change, and as against every passing impulse. Like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
the Humanists, he made it the seat of knowledge—more
than the Humanists, he gave it the control of appetite. In
other words, he adds the idea of will to that of intellect; but
instead of treating them as distinct faculties or functions, he
absolutely identifies them. Mind having come to be first
recognised as a knowing power, carried over its association
with knowledge into the volitional sphere, and the two were
first disentangled by Aristotle, though very imperfectly even
by him. Yet no thinker helped so much to make the
confusion apparent as the one to whom it was due. Socrates
deliberately insisted that those who knew the good must
necessarily be good themselves. He taught that every virtue
was a science; courage, for example, was a knowledge of
the things which should or should not be feared; temperance,
a knowledge of what should or should not be desired, and so
forth. Such an account of virtue would, perhaps, be sufficient
if all men did what, in their opinion, they ought to do; and,
however strange it may seem, Socrates assumed that such
was actually the case.<a id="FNanchor_89_89" href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> The paradox, even if accepted at the
moment by his youthful friends, was sure to be rejected, on
examination, by cooler heads, and its rejection would prove
that the whole doctrine was essentially unsound. Various
causes prevented Socrates from perceiving what seemed so
clear to duller intelligences than his. First of all, he did not
separate duty from personal interest. A true Athenian, he
recommended temperance and righteousness very largely on
account of the material advantages they secured. That the
agreeable and the honourable, the expedient and the just,
frequently came into collision, was at that time a rhetorical
commonplace; and it might be supposed that, if they were
shown to coincide, no motive to misconduct but ignorance
could exist. Then, again, being accustomed to compare
conduct of every kind with the practice of such arts as flute-playing,
he had come to take knowledge in a rather extended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
sense, just as we do when we say, indifferently, that a man
knows geometry and that he knows how to draw. Aristotle
himself did not see more clearly than Socrates that moral
habits are only to be acquired by incessant practice; only the
earlier thinker would have observed that knowledge of every
kind is gained by the same laborious repetition of particular
actions. To the obvious objection that, in this case, morality
cannot, like theoretical truth, be imparted by the teacher to
his pupils, but must be won by the learner for himself, he
would probably have replied that all truth is really evolved
by the mind from itself, and that he, for that very reason,
disclaimed the name of a teacher, and limited himself to the
seemingly humbler task of awakening dormant capacities
in others.</p>

<p>An additional influence, not the less potent because unacknowledged,
was the same craving for a principle of unity
that had impelled early Greek thought to seek for the sole
substance or cause of physical phenomena in some single
material element, whether water, air, or fire; and just as
these various principles were finally decomposed into the
multitudinous atoms of Leucippus, so also, but much more
speedily, did the general principle of knowledge tend to
decompose itself into innumerable cognitions of the partial
ends or utilities which action was directed to achieve. The
need of a comprehensive generalisation again made itself felt,
and all good was summed up under the head of happiness.
The same difficulties recurred under another form. To
define happiness proved not less difficult than to define use
or practical knowledge. Three points of view offered themselves,
and all three had been more or less anticipated by
Socrates. Happiness might mean unmixed pleasure, or the
exclusive cultivation of man’s higher nature, or voluntary
subordination to a larger whole. The founder of Athenian
philosophy used to present each of these, in turn, as an end,
without recognising the possibility of a conflict between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
them; and it certainly would be a mistake to represent them
as constantly opposed. Yet a truly scientific principle must
either prove their identity, or make its choice among them,
or discover something better. Plato seems to have taken up
the three methods, one after the other, without coming to
any very satisfactory conclusion. Aristotle identified the
first two, but failed, or rather did not attempt to harmonise
them with the third. Succeeding schools tried various
combinations, laying more or less stress on different
principles at different periods, till the will of an omnipotent
Creator was substituted for every human standard. With
the decline of dogmatic theology we have seen them all come
to life again, and the old battle is still being fought out under
our eyes. Speaking broadly, it may be said that the method
which we have placed first on the list is more particularly
represented in England, the second in France, and the last
in Germany. Yet they refuse to be separated by any rigid
line of demarcation, and each tends either to combine with
or to pass into one or both of the rival theories. Modern
utilitarianism, as constituted by John Stuart Mill, although
avowedly based on the paramount value of pleasure, in
admitting qualitative differences among enjoyments, and in
subordinating individual to social good, introduces principles
of action which are not, properly speaking, hedonistic.
Neither is the idea of the whole by any means free from
ambiguity. We have party, church, nation, order, progress,
race, humanity, and the sum total of sensitive beings, all
putting in their claims to figure as that entity. Where the
pursuit of any single end gives rise to conflicting pretensions,
a wise man will check them by reference to the other
accredited standards, and will cherish a not unreasonable
expectation that the evolution of life is tending to bring them
all into ultimate agreement.</p>

<p>Returning to Socrates, we must further note that his
identification of virtue with science, though it does not ex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>press
the whole truth, expresses a considerable part of it, especially
as to him conduct was a much more complex problem
than it is to some modern teachers. Only those who believe
in the existence of intuitive and infallible moral perceptions
can consistently maintain that nothing is easier than to know
our duty, and nothing harder than to do it. Even then, the
intuitions must extend beyond general principles, and also
inform us how and where to apply them. That no such inward
illumination exists is sufficiently shown by experience;
so much so that the mischief done by foolish people with
good intentions has become proverbial. Modern casuists
have, indeed, drawn a distinction between the intention and
the act, making us responsible for the purity of the former,
not for the consequences of the latter. Though based on the
Socratic division between mind and body, this distinction
would not have commended itself to Socrates. His object
was not to save souls from sin, but to save individuals,
families, and states from the ruin which ignorance of fact
entails.</p>

<p>If we enlarge our point of view so as to cover the moral
influence of knowledge on society taken collectively, its relative
importance will be vastly increased. When Auguste
Comte assigns the supreme direction of progress to advancing
science, and when Buckle, following Fichte, makes the totality
of human action depend on the totality of human knowledge,
they are virtually attributing to intellectual education an even
more decisive part than it played in the Socratic ethics.
Even those who reject the theory, when pushed to such an
extreme, will admit that the same quantity of self-devotion
must produce a far greater effect when it is guided by deeper
insight into the conditions of existence.</p>

<p>The same principle may be extended in a different direction
if we substitute for knowledge, in its narrower significance,
the more general conception of associated feeling. We shall
then see that belief, habit, emotion, and instinct are only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
different stages of the same process—the process by which
experience is organised and made subservient to vital activity.
The simplest reflex and the highest intellectual
conviction are alike based on sensori-motor mechanism, and,
so far, differ only through the relative complexity and instability
of the nervous connexions involved. Knowledge is
life in the making, and when it fails to control practice fails
only by coming into conflict with passion—that is to say,
with the consolidated results of an earlier experience.
Physiology offers another analogy to the Socratic method
which must not be overlooked. Socrates recommended the
formation of definite conceptions because, among other
advantages, they facilitated the diffusion of useful knowledge.
So, also, the organised associations of feelings are not
only serviceable to individuals, but may be transmitted to
offspring with a regularity proportioned to their definiteness.
How naturally these deductions follow from the doctrine
under consideration, is evident from their having been, to a
certain extent, already drawn by Plato. His plan for the
systematic education of feeling under scientific supervision
answers to the first; his plan for breeding an improved race
of citizens by placing marriage under State control answers
to the second. Yet it is doubtful whether Plato’s predecessor
would have sanctioned any scheme tending to substitute an
external compulsion, whether felt or not, for freedom and
individual initiative, and a blind instinct for the self-consciousness
which can give an account of its procedure at every step.
He would bring us back from social physics and physiology
to psychology, and from psychology to dialectic philosophy.</p>


<h3><a id="III-IV"></a>IV.</h3>

<p>To Socrates himself the strongest reason for believing in
the identity of conviction and practice was, perhaps, that he
had made it a living reality. With him to know the right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
and to do it were the same. In this sense we have already
said that his life was the first verification of his philosophy.
And just as the results of his ethical teaching can only be ideally
separated from their application to his conduct, so also these
results themselves cannot be kept apart from the method by
which they were reached; nor is the process by which he
reached them for himself distinguishable from the process by
which he communicated them to his friends. In touching on
this point, we touch on that which is greatest and most distinctively
original in the Socratic system, or rather in the
Socratic impulse to systematisation of every kind. What it
was will be made clearer by reverting to the central conception
of mind. With Protagoras mind meant an ever-changing
stream of feeling; with Gorgias it was a principle of hopeless
isolation, the interchange of thoughts between one consciousness
and another, by means of signs, being an illusion.
Socrates, on the contrary, attributed to it a steadfast control
over passion, and a unifying function in society through its
essentially synthetic activity, its need of co-operation and
responsive assurance. He saw that the reason which overcomes
animal desire tends to draw men together just as
sensuality tends to drive them into hostile collision. If he
recommended temperance on account of the increased egoistic
pleasure which it secures, he recommended it also as making
the individual a more efficient instrument for serving the
community. If he inculcated obedience to the established
laws, it was no doubt partly on grounds of enlightened self-interest,
but also because union and harmony among citizens
were thereby secured. And if he insisted on the necessity
of forming definite conceptions, it was with the same twofold
reference to personal and public advantage. Along with the
diffusive, social character of mind he recognised its essential
spontaneity. In a commonwealth where all citizens were
free and equal, there must also be freedom and equality of
reason. Having worked out a theory of life for himself, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
desired that all other men should, so far as possible, pass
through the same bracing discipline. Here we have the secret
of his famous erotetic method. He did not, like the Sophists,
give continuous lectures, nor profess, like some of them, to
answer every question that might be put to him. On the
contrary, he put a series of questions to all who came in his
way, generally in the form of an alternative, one side of
which seemed self-evidently true and the other self-evidently
false, arranged so as to lead the respondent, step by step, to
the conclusion which it was desired that he should accept.
Socrates did not invent this method. It had long been
practised in the Athenian law-courts as a means for extracting
from the opposite party admissions which could not
be otherwise obtained, whence it had passed into the tragic
drama, and into the discussion of philosophical problems.
Nowhere else was the analytical power of Greek thought
so brilliantly displayed; for before a contested proposition
could be subjected to this mode of treatment, it had to be
carefully discriminated from confusing adjuncts, considered
under all the various meanings which it might possibly be
made to bear, subdivided, if it was complex, into two or more
distinct assertions, and linked by a minute chain of demonstration
to the admission by which its validity was established
or overthrown.</p>

<p>Socrates, then, did not create the cross-examining
elenchus, but he gave it two new and very important
applications. So far as we can make out, it had hitherto
been only used (again, after the example of the law-courts)
for the purpose of detecting error or intentional deceit. He
made it an instrument for introducing his own convictions
into the minds of others, but so that his interlocutors seemed
to be discovering them for themselves, and were certainly
learning how, in their turn, to practise the same didactic
interrogation on a future occasion. And he also used it for the
purpose of logical self-discipline in a manner which will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
presently explained. Of course, Socrates also employed the
erotetic method as a means of confutation, and, in his hands,
it powerfully illustrated what we have called the negative
moment of Greek thought. To prepare the ground for new
truth it was necessary to clear away the misconceptions
which were likely to interfere with its admission; or, if
Socrates himself had nothing to impart, he could at any rate
purge away the false conceit of knowledge from unformed
minds, and hold them back from attempting difficult tasks
until they were properly qualified for the undertaking. For
example, a certain Glauco, a brother of Plato, had attempted
to address the public assembly, when he was not yet twenty
years of age, and was naturally quite unfitted for the task.
At Athens, where every citizen had a voice in his country’s
affairs, obstruction, whether intentional or not, was very summarily
dealt with. Speakers who had nothing to say that
was worth hearing were forcibly removed from the bêma by
the police; and this fate had already more than once befallen
the youthful orator, much to the annoyance of his friends, who
could not prevail on him to refrain from repeating the experiment,
when Socrates took the matter in hand. One or two
adroit compliments on his ambition drew Glauco into a conversation
with the veteran dialectician on the aims and duties of
a statesman. It was agreed that his first object should be to
benefit the country, and that a good way of achieving this
end would be to increase its wealth, which, again, could be
done either by augmenting the receipts or by diminishing
the expenditure. Could Glauco tell what was the present
revenue of Athens, and whence it was derived?—No; he
had not studied that question.—Well then, perhaps, he had
some useful retrenchments to propose.—No; he had not
studied that either. But the State might, he thought, be enriched
at the expense of its enemies.—A good idea, if we can
be sure of beating them first! Only, to avoid the risk of
attacking somebody who is stronger than ourselves, we must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
know what are the enemy’s military resources as compared
with our own. To begin with the latter: Can Glauco tell
how many ships and soldiers Athens has at her disposal?—No,
he does not at this moment remember.—Then, perhaps,
he has it all written down somewhere?—He must confess
not. So the conversation goes on until Socrates has convicted
his ambitious young friend of possessing no accurate
information whatever about political questions.<a id="FNanchor_90_90" href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></p>

<p>Xenophon has recorded another dialogue in which a young
man named Euthydêmus, who was also in training for a
statesman, and who, as he supposed, had learned a great
deal more out of books than Socrates could teach him, is
brought to see how little he knows about ethical science. He
is asked, Can a man be a good citizen without being just?
No, he cannot.—Can Euthydêmus tell what acts are just?
Yes, certainly, and also what are unjust.—Under which head
does he put such actions as lying, deceiving, harming,
enslaving?—Under the head of injustice.—But suppose a
hostile people are treated in the various manners specified, is
that unjust?—No, but it was understood that only one’s
friends were meant.—Well, if a general encourages his own
army by false statements, or a father deceives his child into
taking medicine, or your friend seems likely to commit
suicide, and you purloin a deadly weapon from him, is that
unjust?—No, we must add ‘for the purpose of harming’ to
our definition. Socrates, however, does not stop here, but
goes on cross-examining until the unhappy student is reduced
to a state of hopeless bewilderment and shame. He is then
brought to perceive the necessity of self-knowledge, which is
explained to mean knowledge of one’s own powers. As a
further exercise Euthydêmus is put through his facings on the
subject of good and evil. Health, wealth, strength, wisdom
and beauty are mentioned as unquestionable goods. Socrates
shows, in the style long afterwards imitated by Juvenal, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
they are only means towards an end, and may be productive
of harm no less than good.—Happiness at any rate is an unquestionable
good.—Yes, unless we make it consist of
questionable goods like those just enumerated.<a id="FNanchor_91_91" href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></p>

<p>It is in this last conversation that the historical Socrates
most nearly resembles the Socrates of Plato’s <cite>Apologia</cite>.
Instead, however, of leaving Euthydêmus to the consciousness
of his ignorance, as the latter would have done, he proceeds,
in Xenophon’s account, to direct the young man’s studies
according to the simplest and clearest principles; and we have
another conversation where religious truths are instilled by
the same catechetical process.<a id="FNanchor_92_92" href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> Here the erotetic method is
evidently a mere didactic artifice, and Socrates could easily
have written out his lesson under the form of a regular
demonstration. But there is little doubt that in other cases
he used it as a means for giving increased precision to his own
ideas, and also for testing their validity, that, in a word, the
habit of oral communication gave him a familiarity with logical
processes which could not otherwise have been acquired.
The same cross-examination that acted as a spur on the mind
of the respondent, reacted as a bridle on the mind of the
interrogator, obliging him to make sure beforehand of every
assertion that he put forward, to study the mutual bearings
of his beliefs, to analyse them into their component elements,
and to examine the relation in which they collectively stood
to the opinions generally accepted. It has already been
stated that Socrates gave the erotetic method two new
applications; we now see in what direction they tended.
He made it a vehicle for positive instruction, and he also
made it an instrument for self-discipline, a help to fulfilling
the Delphic precept, ‘Know thyself.’ The second application
was even more important than the first. With us literary
training—that is, the practice of continuous reading and composition—is
so widely diffused, that conversation has become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
rather a hindrance than a help to the cultivation of argumentative
ability. The reverse was true when Socrates lived.
Long familiarity with debate was unfavourable to the art of
writing; and the speeches in Thucydides show how difficult
it was still found to present close reasoning under the form of
an uninterrupted exposition. The traditions of conversational
thrust and parry survived in rhetorical prose; and the crossed
swords of tongue-fence were represented by the bristling
<i lang="fr">chevaux de frise</i> of a laboured antithetical arrangement where
every clause received new strength and point from contrast
with its opposing neighbour.</p>

<p>By combining the various considerations here suggested
we shall arrive at a clearer understanding of the sceptical
attitude commonly attributed to Socrates. There is, first of
all, the negative and critical function exercised by him in
common with many other constructive thinkers, and intimately
associated with a fundamental law of Greek thought.
Then there is the Attic courtesy and democratic spirit
leading him to avoid any assumption of superiority over those
whose opinions he is examining. And, lastly, there is the
profound feeling that truth is a common possession, which no
individual can appropriate as his peculiar privilege, because it
can only be discovered, tested, and preserved by the united
efforts of all.</p>


<h3><a id="III-V"></a>V.</h3>

<p>Thus, then, the Socratic dialogue has a double aspect. It is,
like all philosophy, a perpetual carrying of life into ideas and
of ideas into life. Life is raised to a higher level by thought;
thought, when brought into contact with life, gains movement
and growth, assimilative and reproductive power. If action is
to be harmonised, we must regulate it by universal principles;
if our principles are to be efficacious, they must be adopted;
if they are to be adopted, we must demonstrate them to the
satisfaction of our contemporaries. Language, consisting as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
it does almost entirely of abstract terms, furnishes the materials
out of which alone such an ideal union can be framed.
But men do not always use the same words, least of all if they
are abstract words, in the same sense, and therefore a preliminary
agreement must be arrived at in this respect; a fact
which Socrates was the first to recognise. Aristotle tells us
that he introduced the custom of constructing general definitions
into philosophy. The need of accurate verbal explanations
is more felt in the discussion of ethical problems than
anywhere else, if we take ethics in the only sense that
Socrates would have accepted, as covering the whole field of
mental activity. It is true that definitions are also employed
in the mathematical and physical sciences, but there they are
accompanied by illustrations borrowed from sensible experience,
and would be unintelligible without them. Hence it has
been possible for those branches of knowledge to make
enormous progress, while the elementary notions on which they
rest have not yet been satisfactorily analysed. The case is
entirely altered when mental dispositions have to be taken into
account. Here, abstract terms play much the same part as
sensible intuitions elsewhere in steadying our conceptions, but
without possessing the same invariable value; the experiences
from which those conceptions are derived being exceedingly
complex, and, what is more, exceedingly liable to disturbance
from unforeseen circumstances. Thus, by neglecting a series
of minute changes the same name may come to denote groups
of phenomena not agreeing in the qualities which alone it originally
connoted. More than one example of such a gradual
metamorphosis has already presented itself in the course of our
investigation, and others will occur in the sequel. Where distinctions
of right and wrong are involved, it is of enormous
practical importance that a definite meaning should be attached to
words, and that they should not be allowed, at least without
express agreement, to depart from the recognised acceptation:
for such words, connoting as they do the approval or disap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>proval
of mankind, exercise a powerful influence on conduct,
so that their misapplication may lead to disastrous consequences.
Where government by written law prevails the
importance of defining ethical terms immediately becomes
obvious, for, otherwise, personal rule would be restored under
the disguise of judicial interpretation. Roman jurisprudence
was the first attempt on a great scale to introduce a rigorous
system of definitions into legislation. We have seen, in the
preceding chapter, how it tended to put the conclusions of
Greek naturalistic philosophy into practical shape. We now
see how, on the formal side, its determinations are connected
with the principles of Socrates. And we shall not undervalue
this obligation if we bear in mind that the accurate
wording of legal enactments is not less important than the
essential justice of their contents. Similarly, the development
of Catholic theology required that its fundamental conceptions
should be progressively defined. This alone preserved
the intellectual character of Catholicism in ages of ignorance
and superstition, and helped to keep alive the reason by which
superstition was eventually overthrown. Mommsen has called
theology the bastard child of Religion and Science. It is
something that, in the absence of the robuster parent, its
features should be recalled and its tradition maintained even
by an illegitimate offspring.</p>

<p>So far, we have spoken as if the Socratic definitions were
merely verbal; they were, however, a great deal more, and
their author did not accurately discriminate between what at
that stage of thought could not well be kept apart—explanations
of words, practical reforms, and scientific generalisations.
For example, in defining a ruler to be one who knew more
than other men, he was departing from the common usages of
language, and showing not what was, but what ought to be
true.<a id="FNanchor_93_93" href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> And in defining virtue as wisdom, he was putting
forward a new theory of his own, instead of formulating the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
received connotation of a term. Still, after making every
deduction, we cannot fail to perceive what an immense service
was rendered to exact thought by introducing definitions of
every kind into that department of enquiry where they were
chiefly needed. We may observe also that a general law of
Greek intelligence was here realising itself in a new direction.
The need of accurate determination had always been felt, but
hitherto it had worked under the more elementary forms of
time, space, and causality, or, to employ the higher generalisation
of modern psychology, under the form of contiguous
association. The earlier cosmologies were all processes of circumscription;
they were attempts to fix the limits of the
universe, and, accordingly, that element which was supposed to
surround the others was also conceived as their producing
cause, or else (in the theory of Heracleitus) as typifying the
rationale of their continuous transformation. For this reason
Parmenides, when he identified existence with extension, found
himself obliged to declare that extension was necessarily
limited. Of all the physical thinkers, Anaxagoras, who immediately
precedes Socrates, approaches, on the objective side,
most nearly to his standpoint. For the governing Nous brings
order out of chaos by segregating the confused elements, by
separating the unlike and drawing the like together, which is
precisely what definition does for our conceptions. Meanwhile
Greek literature had been performing the same task in a more
restricted province, first fixing events according to their
geographical and historical positions, then assigning to each
its proper cause, then, as Thucydides does, isolating the most
important groups of events from their external connexions,
and analysing the causes of complex changes into different
classes of antecedents. The final revolution effected by
Socrates was to substitute arrangement by difference and
resemblance for arrangement by contiguity in coexistence
and succession. To say that by so doing he created science
is inexact, for science requires to consider nature under every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
aspect, including those which he systematically neglected;
but we may say that he introduced the method which is most
particularly applicable to mental phenomena, the method of
ideal analysis, classification, and reasoning. For, be it
observed that Socrates did not limit himself to searching for
the One in the Many, he also, and perhaps more habitually,
sought for the Many in the One. He would take hold of a
conception and analyse it into its various notes, laying them,
as it were, piecemeal before his interlocutor for separate
acceptance or rejection. If, for example, they could not
agree about the relative merits of two citizens, Socrates would
decompose the character of a good citizen into its component
parts and bring the comparison down to them. A good
citizen, he would say, increases the national resources by his
administration of the finances, defeats the enemy abroad,
wins allies by his diplomacy, appeases dissension by his
eloquence at home.<a id="FNanchor_94_94" href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> When the shy and gifted Charmides
shrank from addressing a public audience on public questions,
Socrates strove to overcome his nervousness by mercilessly
subdividing the august Ecclêsia into its constituent classes.
‘Is it the fullers that you are afraid of?’ he asked, ‘or the
leather-cutters, or the masons, or the smiths, or the husbandmen,
or the traders, or the lowest class of hucksters?’<a id="FNanchor_95_95" href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> Here
the analytical power of Greek thought is manifested with still
more searching effect than when it was applied to space and
motion by Zeno.</p>

<p>Nor did Socrates only consider the whole conception in
relation to its parts, he also grouped conceptions together
according to their genera and founded logical classification.
To appreciate the bearing of this idea on human interests it
will be enough to study the disposition of a code. We shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
then see how much more easy it becomes to bring individual
cases under a general rule, and to retain the whole body of
rules in our memory, when we can pass step by step from the
most universal to the most particular categories. Now, it
was by jurists versed in the Stoic philosophy that Roman law
was codified, and it was by Stoicism that the traditions of
Socratic philosophy were most faithfully preserved.</p>

<p>Logical division is, however, a process not fully represented
by any fixed and formal distribution of topics, nor yet
is it equivalent to the arrangement of genera and species
according to their natural affinities, as in the admirable
systems of Jussieu and Cuvier. It is something much more
flexible and subtle, a carrying down into the minutest detail,
of that psychological law which requires, as a condition of
perfect consciousness, that feelings, conceptions, judgments,
and, generally speaking, all mental modes should be apprehended
together with their contradictory opposites. Heracleitus
had a dim perception of this truth when he taught the
identity of antithetical couples, and it is more or less vividly
illustrated by all Greek classic literature after him; but
Socrates seems to have been the first who transformed it from
a law of existence into a law of cognition; with him knowledge
and ignorance, reason and passion, freedom and slavery,
virtue, and vice, right and wrong (πολλῶν ὀνομάτων μορφὴ
μία) were apprehended in inseparable connexion, and were
employed for mutual elucidation, not only in broad masses,
but also through their last subdivisions, like the delicate
adjustments of light and shade on a Venetian canvas. This
method of classification by graduated descent and symmetrical
contrast, like the whole dialectic system of which it forms
a branch, is only suited to the mental phenomena for which
it was originally devised; and Hegel committed a fatal error
when he applied it to explain the order of external coexistence
and succession. We have already touched on the
essentially subjective character of the Socratic definition, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
we shall presently have to make a similar restriction in
dealing with Socratic induction. With regard to the question
last considered, our limits will not permit us, nor, indeed, does
it fall within the scope of our present study, to pursue a vein
of reflection which was never fully worked out either by the
Athenian philosophers or by their modern successors, at least
not in its only legitimate direction.</p>

<p>After definition and division comes reasoning. We arrange
objects in classes, that by knowing one or some we may know
all. Aristotle attributes to Socrates the first systematic
employment of induction as well as of general definitions.<a id="FNanchor_96_96" href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">96</a>
Nevertheless, his method was not solely inductive, nor did it
bear more than a distant resemblance to the induction of
modern science. His principles were not gathered from the
particular classes of phenomena which they determined, or
were intended to determine, but from others of an analogous
character which had already been reduced to order. Observing
that all handicrafts were practised according to well-defined
intelligible rules, leading, so far as they went, to satisfactory
results, he required that life in its entirety should be similarly
systematised. This was not so much reasoning as a demand
for the more extended application of reasoning. It was a
truly philosophic postulate, for philosophy is not science, but
precedes and underlies it. Belief and action tend to divide
themselves into two provinces, of which the one is more or
less organised, the other more or less chaotic. We philosophise
when we try to bring the one into order, and also when
we test the foundations on which the order of the other reposes,
fighting both against incoherent mysticism and against
traditional routine. Such is the purpose that the most distinguished
thinkers of modern times—Francis Bacon, Spinoza,
Hume, Kant, Auguste Comte, and Herbert Spencer—however
widely they may otherwise differ, have, according to their respective
lights, all set themselves to achieve. No doubt, there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
this vast difference between Socrates and his most recent successors,
that physical science is the great type of certainty to
the level of which they would raise all speculation, while with
him it was the type of a delusion and an impossibility. The
analogy of artistic production when applied to Nature led him
off on a completely false track, the ascription to conscious
design of that which is, in truth, a result of mechanical causation.<a id="FNanchor_97_97" href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">97</a>
But now that the relations between the known and
the unknown have been completely transformed, there is no
excuse for repeating the fallacies which imposed on his vigorous
understanding; and the genuine spirit of Socrates is best
represented by those who, starting like him from the data of
experience, are led to adopt a diametrically opposite conclusion.
We may add, that the Socratic method of analogical
reasoning gave a retrospective justification to early Greek
thought, of which Socrates was not himself aware. Its daring
generalisations were really an inference from the known to the
unknown. To interpret all physical processes in terms of
matter and motion, is only assuming that the changes to which
our senses cannot penetrate are homogeneous with the changes
which we can feel and see. When Socrates argued that,
because the human body is animated by a consciousness, the
material universe must be similarly animated, Democritus
might have answered that the world presents no appearance
of being organised like an animal. When he argued that,
because statues and pictures are known to be the work of intelligence,
the living models from which they are copied must
be similarly due to design, Aristodêmus should have answered,
that the former are seen to be manufactured, while the others
are seen to grow. It might also have been observed, that if
our own intelligence requires to be accounted for by a cause
like itself, so also does the creative cause, and so on through
an infinite regress of antecedents. Teleology has been destroyed
by the Darwinian theory; but before the <cite>Origin of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
Species</cite> appeared, the slightest scrutiny might have shown
that it was a precarious foundation for religious belief. If
many thoughtful men are now turning away from theism,
‘natural theology’ may be thanked for the desertion. ‘I
believe in God,’ says the German baron in <cite>Thorndale</cite>, ‘until
your philosophers demonstrate His existence.’ ‘And then?’
asks a friend. ‘And then—I do not believe the demonstration.’</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the errors into which Socrates
fell, he did not commit the fatal mistake of compromising his
ethical doctrine by associating it indissolubly with his metaphysical
opinions. Religion, with him, instead of being the
source and sanction of all duty, simply brought in an additional
duty—that of gratitude to the gods for their goodness. We
shall presently see where he sought for the ultimate foundation
of morality, after completing our survey of the dialectic
method with which it was so closely connected. The induction
of Socrates, when it went beyond that kind of analogical
reasoning which we have just been considering, was mainly
abstraction, the process by which he obtained those general
conceptions or definitions which played so great a part in his
philosophy. Thus, on comparing the different virtues, as
commonly distinguished, he found that they all agreed in
requiring knowledge, which he accordingly concluded to be
the essence of virtue. So other moralists have been led to
conclude that right actions resemble one another in their
felicific quality, and In that alone. Similarly, political economists
find, or formerly found (for we do not wish to be positive
on the matter), that a common characteristic of all industrial
employments is the desire to secure the maximum of profit
with the minimum of trouble. Another comparison shows
that value depends on the relation between supply and
demand. Aesthetic enjoyments of every kind resemble one
another by including an element of ideal emotion. It is
a common characteristic of all cognitions that they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
constructed by association out of elementary feelings. All
societies are marked by a more or less developed division of
labour. These are given as typical generalisations which have
been reached by the Socratic method. They are all taken
from the philosophic sciences—that is, the sciences dealing
with phenomena which are partly determined by mind, and
the systematic treatment of which is so similar that they are
frequently studied in combination by a single thinker, and
invariably so by the greatest thinkers of any. But were we
to examine the history of the physical sciences, we should
find that this method of wide comparison and rapid abstraction
cannot, as Francis Bacon imagined, be successfully
applied to them. The facts with which they deal are not
transparent, not directly penetrable by thought; hence they
must be treated deductively. Instead of a front attack, we
must, so to speak, take them in the rear. Bacon never made
a more unfortunate observation than when he said that the
syllogism falls far short of the subtlety of Nature. Nature is
even simpler than the syllogism, for she accomplishes her
results by advancing from equation to equation. That which
really does fall far short of her subtlety is precisely the
Baconian induction with its superficial comparison of instances.
No amount of observation could detect any resemblance
between the bursting of a thunderstorm and the attraction of a
loadstone, or between the burning of charcoal and the rusting
a nail.</p>

<p>But while philosophers cannot prescribe a method to
physical science, they may, to a certain extent, bring it under
their cognisance, by disengaging its fundamental conceptions
and assumptions, and showing that they are functions of
mind; by arranging the special sciences in systematic order
for purposes of study; and by investigating the law of their
historical evolution. Furthermore, since psychology is the
central science of philosophy, and since it is closely connected
with physiology, which in turn reposes on the inorganic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
sciences, a certain knowledge of the objective world is indispensable
to any knowledge of ourselves. Lastly, since the
subjective sphere not only rests, once for all, on the objective,
but is also in a continual state of action and reaction with it,
no philosophy can be complete which does not take into
account the constitution of things as they exist independently
of ourselves, in order to ascertain how far they are unalterable,
and how far they may be modified to our advantage. We
see, then, that Socrates, in restricting philosophy to human
interests, was guided by a just tact; that in creating the
method of dialectic abstraction, he created an instrument
adequate to this investigation, but to this alone; and, finally,
that human interests, understood in the largest sense, embrace
a number of subsidiary studies which either did not exist
when he taught, or which the inevitable superstitions of his
age would not allow him to pursue.</p>

<p>It remains to glance at another aspect of the dialectic
method first developed on a great scale by Plato, and first
fully defined by Aristotle, but already playing a certain part
in the Socratic teaching. This is the testing of common
assumptions by pushing them to their logical conclusion, and
rejecting those which lead to consequences inconsistent with
themselves. So understood, dialectic means the complete
elimination of inconsistency, and has ever since remained the
most powerful weapon of philosophical criticism. To take an
instance near at hand, it is constantly employed by thinkers
so radically different as Mr. Herbert Spencer and Professor
T. H. Green; while it has been generalised into an objective
law of Nature and history, with dazzling though only momentary
success, by Hegel and his school.</p>


<h3><a id="III-VI"></a>VI.</h3>

<p>Consistency is, indeed, the one word which, better than
any other, expresses the whole character of Socrates, and the
whole of philosophy as well. Here the supreme conception<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
of mind reappears under its most rigorous, but, at the same
time, its most beneficent aspect. It is the temperance which
no allurement can surprise; the fortitude which no terror can
break through; the justice which eliminates all personal
considerations, egoistic and altruistic alike; the truthfulness
which, with exactest harmony, fits words to meanings, meanings
to thoughts, and thoughts to things; the logic which will
tolerate no self-contradiction; the conviction which seeks for
no acceptance unwon by reason; the liberalism which works
through free agencies for freedom; the love which wills
another’s good for that other’s sake alone.<a id="FNanchor_98_98" href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> It was the intellectual
passion for consistency which made Socrates so great and
which fused his life into a flawless whole; but it was an unconscious
motive power, and therefore he attributed to mere
knowledge what knowledge alone could not supply. A clear
perception of right cannot by itself secure the obedience of
our will. High principles are not of any value, except to
those in whom a discrepancy between practice and profession
produces the sharpest anguish of which their nature is capable;
a feeling like, though immeasurably stronger than, that which
women of exquisite sensibility experience when they see a
candle set crooked or a table-cover awry. How moral laws
have come to be established, and why they prescribe or prohibit
certain classes of actions, are questions which still divide
the schools, though with an increasing consensus of authority
on the utilitarian side: their ultimate sanction—that which,
whatever they are, makes obedience to them truly moral—can
hardly be sought elsewhere than in the same consciousness of
logical stringency that determines, or should determine, our
abstract beliefs.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, we venture to hope that a principle has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
been here suggested deep and strong enough to reunite the
two halves into which historians have hitherto divided the
Socratic system, or, rather, the beginning of that universal
systematisation called philosophy, which is not yet, and
perhaps never will be, completed; a principle which is outwardly
revealed in the character of the philosopher himself.
With such an one, ethics and dialectics become almost indistinguishable
through the intermixture of their processes and
the parallelism of their aims. Integrity of conviction enters,
both as a means and as an element, into perfect integrity of
conduct, nor can it be maintained where any other element of
rectitude is wanting. Clearness, consecutiveness, and coherence
are the morality of belief; while temperance, justice,
and beneficence, taken in their widest sense and taken
together, constitute the supreme logic of life.</p>

<p>It has already been observed that the thoughts of Socrates
were thrown into shape for and by communication, that they
only became definite when brought into vivifying contact with
another intelligence. Such was especially the case with his
method of ethical dialectic. Instead of tendering his advice
in the form of a lecture, as other moralists have at all times
been so fond of doing, he sought out some pre-existing sentiment
or opinion inconsistent with the conduct of which he
disapproved, and then gradually worked round from point to
point, until theory and practice were exhibited in immediate
contrast. Here, his reasoning, which is sometimes spoken of
as exclusively inductive, was strictly syllogistic, being the
application of a general law to a particular instance. With
the growing emancipation of reason, we may observe a return
to the Socratic method of moralisation. Instead of rewards
and punishments, which encourage selfish calculation, or
examples, which stimulate a mischievous jealousy when they
do not create a spirit of servile imitation, the judicious trainer
will find his motive power in the pupil’s incipient tendency
to form moral judgments, which, when reflected on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
individual’s own actions, become what we call a conscience.
It has been mentioned in the preceding chapter that the
celebrated golden rule of justice was already enunciated by
Greek moralists in the fourth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> Possibly it may
have been first formulated by Socrates. In all cases it occurs
in the writings of his disciples, and happily expresses the
drift of his entire philosophy. This generalising tendency
was, indeed, so natural to a noble Greek, that instances of it
occur long before philosophy began. We find it in the
famous question of Achilles: ‘Did not this whole war begin
on account of a woman? Are the Atreidae the only men
who love their wives?’<a id="FNanchor_99_99" href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> and in the now not less famous
apostrophe to Lycaon, reminding him that an early death is
the lot of far worthier men than he<a id="FNanchor_100_100" href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">100</a>—utterances which come
on us with the awful effect of lightning flashes, that illuminate
the whole horizon of existence while they paralyse or destroy
an individual victim.</p>

<p>The power which Socrates possessed of rousing other
minds to independent activity and apostolic transmission of
spiritual gifts was, as we have said, the second verification of
his doctrine. Even those who, like Antisthenes and Aristippus,
derived their positive theories from the Sophists rather
than from him, preferred to be regarded as his followers; and
Plato, from whom his ideas received their most splendid
development, has acknowledged the debt by making that
venerated figure the centre of his own immortal Dialogues.
A third verification is given by the subjective, practical,
dialectic tendency of all subsequent philosophy properly so
called. On this point we will content ourselves with mentioning
one instance out of many, the recent declaration of
Mr. Herbert Spencer that his whole system was constructed
for the sake of its ethical conclusion.<a id="FNanchor_101_101" href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">101</a></p>

<p>Apart, however, from abstract speculation, the ideal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
method seems to have exercised an immediate and powerful
influence on Art, an influence which was anticipated by
Socrates himself. In two conversations reported by Xenophon,<a id="FNanchor_102_102" href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">102</a>
he impresses on Parrhasius, the painter, and Cleito, the
sculptor, the importance of so animating the faces and figures
which they represented as to make them express human
feelings, energies, and dispositions, particularly those of the
most interesting and elevated type. And such, in fact, was
the direction followed by imitative art after Pheidias, though
not without degenerating into a sensationalism which Socrates
would have severely condemned. Another and still more
remarkable proof of the influence exercised on plastic representation
by ideal philosophy was, perhaps, not foreseen
by its founder. We allude to the substitution of abstract and
generic for historical subjects by Greek sculpture in its later
stages, and not by sculpture only, but by dramatic poetry as
well. For early art, whether it addressed itself to the eye or
to the imagination, and whether its subjects were taken from
history or from fiction, had always been historical in this
sense, that it exhibited the performance of particular actions
by particular persons in a given place and at a given time;
the mode of presentment most natural to those whose ideas
are mainly determined by contiguous association. The schools
which came after Socrates let fall the limitations of concrete
reality, and found the unifying principle of their works in
association by resemblance, making their figures the personification
of a single attribute or group of attributes, and bringing
together forms distinguished by the community of their characteristics
or the convergence of their functions. Thus Aphroditê
no longer figured as the lover of Arês or Anchisês, but as
the personification of female beauty; while her statues were
grouped together with images of the still more transparent
abstractions, Love, Longing, and Desire. Similarly Apollo
became a personification of musical enthusiasm, and Dionysus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
of Bacchic inspiration. So also dramatic art, once completely
historical, even with Aristophanes, now chose for its subjects
such constantly-recurring types as the ardent lover, the stern
father, the artful slave, the boastful soldier, and the fawning
parasite.<a id="FNanchor_103_103" href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></p>

<p>Nor was this all. Thought, after having, as it would seem,
wandered away from reality in search of empty abstractions,
by the help of those very abstractions regained possession of
concrete existence, and acquired a far fuller intelligence of its
complex manifestations. For, each individual character is an
assemblage of qualities, and can only be understood when
those qualities, after having been separately studied, are
finally recombined. Thus, biography is a very late production
of literature, and although biographies are the favourite reading
of those who most despise philosophy, they could never
have been written without its help. Moreover, before characters
can be described they must exist. Now, it is partly
philosophy which calls character into existence by sedulous
inculcation of self-knowledge and self-culture, by consolidating
a man’s individuality into something independent of circumstances,
so that it comes to form, not a figure in bas-relief,
but what sculptors call a figure in the round. Such was
Socrates himself, and such were the figures which he taught
Xenophon and Plato to recognise and portray. Character-drawing
begins with them, and the <cite>Memorabilia</cite> in particular
is the earliest attempt at a biographical analysis that we
possess. From this to Plutarch’s <cite>Lives</cite> there was still a long
journey to be accomplished, but the interval between them is
less considerable than that which divides Xenophon from his
immediate predecessor, Thucydides. And when we remember
how intimately the substance of Christian teaching is connected
with the literary form of its first record, we shall still better
appreciate the all-penetrating influence of Hellenic thought,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
vying, as it does, with the forces of nature in subtlety and
universal diffusion.</p>

<p>Besides transforming art and literature, the dialectic
method helped to revolutionise social life, and the impulse
communicated in this direction is still very far from being
exhausted. We allude to its influence on female education.
The intellectual blossoming of Athens was aided, in its first
development, by a complete separation of the sexes. There
were very few of his friends to whom an Athenian gentleman
talked so little as to his wife.<a id="FNanchor_104_104" href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> Colonel Mure aptly compares
her position to that of an English housekeeper, with considerably
less liberty than is enjoyed by the latter. Yet the union
of tender admiration with the need for intelligent sympathy
and the desire to awaken interest in noble pursuits existed at
Athens in full force, and created a field for its exercise.
Wilhelm von Humboldt has observed that at this time chivalrous
love was kept alive by customs which, to us, are intensely
repellent. That so valuable a sentiment should be preserved
and diverted into a more legitimate channel was an object of
the highest importance. The naturalistic method of ethics
did much, but it could not do all, for more was required than
a return to primitive simplicity. Here the method of mind
stepped in and supplied the deficiency. Reciprocity was the
soul of dialectic as practised by Socrates, and the dialectic of
love demands a reciprocity of passion which can only exist
between the sexes. But in a society where the free intercourse
of modern Europe was not permitted, the modern sentiment
could not be reached at a single bound; and those who sought
for the conversation of intelligent women had to seek for it
among a class of which Aspasia was the highest representative.
Such women played a great part in later Athenian society;
they attended philosophical lectures, furnished heroines to
the New Comedy, and on the whole gave a healthier tone
to literature. Their successors, the Delias and Cynthias of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
Roman elegiac poetry, called forth strains of exalted affection
which need nothing but a worthier object to place them on a
level with the noblest expressions of tenderness that have
since been heard. Here at least, to understand is to forgive;
and we shall be less scandalised than certain critics,<a id="FNanchor_105_105" href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> we shall
even refuse to admit that Socrates fell below the dignity of a
moralist, when we hear that he once visited a celebrated
beauty of this class, Theodotê by name;<a id="FNanchor_106_106" href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> that he engaged
her in a playful conversation; and that he taught her to put
more mind into her profession; to attract by something
deeper than personal charms; to show at least an appearance
of interest in the welfare of her lovers; and to stimulate their
ardour by a studied reserve, granting no favour that had not
been repeatedly and passionately sought after.</p>

<p>Xenophon gives the same interest a more edifying direction
when he enlivens the dry details of his <cite>Cyropaedia</cite> with
touching episodes of conjugal affection, or presents lessons in
domestic economy under the form of conversations between a
newly-married couple.<a id="FNanchor_107_107" href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> Plato in some respects transcends, in
others falls short of his less gifted contemporary. For his
doctrine of love as an educating process—a true doctrine, all
sneers and perversions notwithstanding—though readily
applicable to the relation of the sexes, is not applied to it by
him; and his project of a common training for men and
women, though suggestive of a great advance on the existing
system if rightly carried out, was, from his point of view,
a retrograde step towards savage or even animal life, an
attempt to throw half the burdens incident to a military
organisation of society on those who had become absolutely
incapable of bearing them.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the dialectic method proved stronger than its
own creators, and, once set going, introduced feelings and ex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>periences
of which they had never dreamed, within the
horizon of philosophic consciousness. It was found that if
women had much to learn, much also might be learned from
them. Their wishes could not be taken into account without
giving a greatly increased prominence in the guidance of
conduct to such sentiments as fidelity, purity, and pity; and
to that extent the religion which they helped to establish has,
at least in principle, left no room for any further progress.
On the other hand, it is only by reason that the more
exclusively feminine impulses can be freed from their
primitive narrowness and elevated into truly human emotions.
Love, when left to itself, causes more pain than pleasure, for
the words of the old idyl still remain true which associate it
with jealousy as cruel as the grave; pity, without prevision,
creates more suffering than it relieves; and blind fidelity is
instinctively opposed even to the most beneficent changes.
We are still suffering from the excessive preponderance which
Catholicism gave to the ideas of women; but we need not
listen to those who tell us that the varied experiences of
humanity cannot be organised into a rational, consistent, self-supporting
whole.</p>

<p>A survey of the Socratic philosophy would be incomplete
without some comment on an element in the life of Socrates,
which at first sight seems to lie altogether outside philosophy.
There is no fact in his history more certain than that he
believed himself to be constantly accompanied by a Daemonium,
a divine voice often restraining him, even in trifling
matters, but never prompting to positive action. That it was
neither conscience in our sense of the word, nor a supposed
familiar spirit, is now generally admitted. Even those who
believe in the supernatural origin and authority of our moral
feelings do not credit them with a power of divining the
accidentally good or evil consequences which may attend on
our most trivial and indifferent actions; while, on the other
hand, those feelings have a positive no less than a negative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
function, which is exhibited whenever the performance of
good deeds becomes a duty. That the Daemonium was not
a personal attendant is proved by the invariable use of an
indefinite neuter adjective to designate it. How the phenomenon
itself should be explained is a question for professional
pathologists. We have here to account for the interpretation
put upon it by Socrates, and this, in our judgment, follows
quite naturally from his characteristic mode of thought.
That the gods should signify their pleasure by visible signs
and public oracles was an experience familiar to every
Greek. Socrates, conceiving God as a mind diffused through
the whole universe, would look for traces of the Divine
presence in his own mind, and would readily interpret any
inward suggestion, not otherwise to be accounted for, as a
manifestation of this all-pervading power. Why it should
invariably appear under the form of a restraint is less obvious.
The only explanation seems to be that, as a matter of fact,
such mysterious feelings, whether the product of unconscious
experience or not, do habitually operate as deterrents rather
than as incentives.</p>


<h3><a id="III-VII"></a>VII.</h3>

<p>This Daemonium, whatever it may have been, formed
one of the ostensible grounds on which its possessor was
prosecuted and condemned to death for impiety. We might
have spared ourselves the trouble of going over the circumstances
connected with that tragical event, had not various
attempts been made in some well-known works to extenuate
the significance of a singularly atrocious crime. The case
stands thus. In the year 399 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> Socrates, who was then
over seventy, and had never in his life been brought before a
law-court, was indicted on the threefold charge of introducing
new divinities, of denying those already recognised by the
State, and of corrupting young men. His principal accuser
was one Melêtus, a poet, supported by Lycon, a rhetorician,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
and by a much more powerful backer, Anytus, a leading
citizen in the restored democracy. The charge was tried
before a large popular tribunal, numbering some five hundred
members. Socrates regarded the whole affair with profound
indifference. When urged to prepare a defence, he replied,
with justice, that he had been preparing it his whole life long.
He could not, indeed, have easily foreseen what line the
prosecutors would take. Our own information on this point
is meagre enough, being principally derived from allusions
made by Xenophon, who was not himself present at the trial.
There seems, however, no unfairness in concluding that the
charge of irreligion neither was nor could be substantiated.
The evidence of Xenophon is quite sufficient to establish the
unimpeachable orthodoxy of his friend. If it really was
an offence at Athens to believe in gods unrecognised by the
State, Socrates was not guilty of that offence, for his Daemonium
was not a new divinity, but a revelation from the
established divinities, such as individual believers have at
all times been permitted to receive even by the most jealous
religious communities. The imputation of infidelity, commonly
and indiscriminately brought against all philosophers,
was a particularly unhappy one to fling at the great opponent
of physical science, who, besides, was noted for the punctual
discharge of his religious duties. That the first two counts
of the indictment should be so frivolous raises a strong
prejudice against the third. The charges of corruption seem
to have come under two heads—alleged encouragement of
disrespect to parents, and of disaffection towards democratic
institutions. In support of the former some innocent expressions
let fall by Socrates seem to have been taken up and
cruelly perverted. By way of stimulating his young friends
to improve their minds, he had observed that relations were
only of value when they could help one another, and that to
do so they must be properly educated. This was twisted into
an assertion that ignorant parents might properly be placed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
under restraint by their better-informed children. That such
an inference could not have been sanctioned by Socrates
himself is obvious from his insisting on the respect due even
to so intolerable a mother as Xanthippê.<a id="FNanchor_108_108" href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> The political
opinions of the defendant presented a more vulnerable point
for attack. He thought the custom of choosing magistrates
by lot absurd, and did not conceal his contempt for it. There
is, however, no reason for believing that such purely theoretical
criticisms were forbidden by law or usage at Athens. At
any rate, much more revolutionary sentiments were tolerated
on the stage. That Socrates would be no party to a violent
subversion of the Constitution, and would regard it with high
disapproval, was abundantly clear both from his life and
from the whole tenor of his teaching. In opposition to
Hippias, he defined justice as obedience to the law of the
land. The chances of the lot had, on one memorable occasion,
called him to preside over the deliberations of the
Sovereign Assembly. A proposition was made, contrary to
law, that the generals who were accused of having abandoned
the crews of their sunken ships at Arginusae should be tried
in a single batch. In spite of tremendous popular clamour,
Socrates refused to put the question to the vote on the single
day for which his office lasted. The just and resolute man,
who would not yield to the unrighteous demands of a crowd,
had shortly afterwards to face the threats of a frowning
tyrant. When the Thirty were installed in power, he publicly,
and at the risk of his life, expressed disapproval of their
sanguinary proceedings. The oligarchy, wishing to involve
as many respectable citizens as possible in complicity with
their crimes, sent for five persons, of whom Socrates was one,
and ordered them to bring a certain Leo from Salamis, that
he might be put to death; the others obeyed, but Socrates
refused to accompany them on their disgraceful errand.
Nevertheless, it told heavily against the philosopher that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
Alcibiades, the most mischievous of demagogues, and Critias,
the most savage of aristocrats, passed for having been educated
by him. It was remembered, also, that he was in the
habit of quoting a passage from Homer, where Odysseus is
described as appealing to the reason of the chiefs, while he
brings inferior men to their senses with rough words and
rougher chastisement. In reality, Socrates did not mean that
the poor should be treated with brutality by the rich, for he
would have been the first to suffer had such license been
permitted, but he meant that where reason failed harsher
methods of coercion must be applied. Precisely because
expressions of opinion let fall in private conversation are so
liable to be misunderstood or purposely perverted, to adduce
them in support of a capital charge where no overt act can be
alleged, is the most mischievous form of encroachment on
individual liberty.</p>

<p>Modern critics, beginning with Hegel,<a id="FNanchor_109_109" href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> have discovered
reasons for considering Socrates a dangerous character, which
apparently did not occur to Melêtus and his associates. We
are told that the whole system of applying dialectics to
morality had an unsettling tendency, for if men were once
taught that the sacredness of duty rested on their individual
conviction they might refuse to be convinced, and act accordingly.
And it is further alleged that Socrates first introduced
this principle of subjectivity into morals. The persecuting
spirit is so insatiable that in default of acts it attacks
opinions, and in default of specific opinions it fastens on
general tendencies. We know that Joseph de Maistre was
suspected by his ignorant neighbours of being a Revolutionist
because most of his time was spent in study; and but the
other day a French preacher was sent into exile by his ecclesiastical
superiors for daring to support Catholic morality
on rational grounds.<a id="FNanchor_110_110" href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> Fortunately Greek society was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
subject to the rules of the Dominican Order. Never anywhere
in Greece, certainly not at Athens, did there exist that
solid, all-comprehensive, unquestionable fabric of traditional
obligation assumed by Hegel; and Zeller is conceding far
too much when he defends Socrates, on the sole ground that
the recognised standards of right had fallen into universal
contempt during the Peloponnesian war, while admitting that
he might fairly have been silenced at an earlier period, if
indeed his teaching could have been conceived as possible
before it actually began.<a id="FNanchor_111_111" href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> For from the first, both in literature
and in life, Greek thought is distinguished by an ardent
desire to get to the bottom of every question, and to discover
arguments of universal applicability for every decision. Even
in the youth of Pericles knotty ethical problems were eagerly
discussed without any interference on the part of the public
authorities. Experience had to prove how far-reaching was
the effect of ideas before a systematic attempt could be made
to control them.</p>

<p>In what terms Socrates replied to his accusers cannot be
stated with absolute certainty. Reasons have been already
given for believing that the speech put into his mouth by
Plato is not entirely historical; and here we may mention as
a further reason that the specific charges mentioned by
Xenophon are not even alluded to in it. This much, however,
is clear, that the defence was of a thoroughly dignified
character; and that, while the allegations of the prosecution
were successfully rebutted, the defendant stood entirely on
his innocence, and refused to make any of the customary but
illegal appeals to the compassion of the court. We are
assured that he was condemned solely on account of this
defiant attitude, and by a very small majority. Melêtus
had demanded the penalty of death, but by Attic law
Socrates had the right of proposing some milder sentence as
an alternative. According to Plato, he began by stating that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
the justest return for his entire devotion to the public good
would be maintenance at the public expense during the
remainder of his life, an honour usually granted to victors at
the Olympic games. In default of this he proposed a fine of
thirty minae, to be raised by contributions among his
friends. According to another account,<a id="FNanchor_112_112" href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> he refused, on the
ground of his innocence, to name any alternative penalty. On
a second division Socrates was condemned to death by a
much larger majority than that which had found him guilty,
eighty of those who had voted for his acquittal now voting for
his execution.</p>

<p>Such was the transaction which some moderns, Grote
among the number, holding Socrates to be one of the best
and wisest of men, have endeavoured to excuse. Their argument
is that the illustrious victim was jointly responsible for
his own fate, and that he was really condemned, not for his
teaching, but for contempt of court. To us it seems that this
is a distinction without a difference. What has been so finely
said of space and time may be said also of the Socratic life
and the Socratic doctrine; each was contained entire in
every point of the other. Such as he appeared to the
Dicastery, such also he appeared everywhere, always, and
to all men, offering them the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth. If conduct like his was not permissible
in a court of law, then it was not permissible at all;
if justice could not be administered without reticences,
evasions, and disguises, where was sincerity ever to be practised?
If reason was not to be the paramount arbitress in
questions of public interest, what issues could ever be
entrusted to her decision? Admit every extenuating circumstance
that the utmost ingenuity can devise, and from
every point of view one fact will come out clearly, that
Socrates was impeached as a philosopher, that he defended
himself like a philosopher, and that he was condemned to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
death because he was a philosopher. Those who attempt to
remove this stain from the character of the Athenian people
will find that, like the blood-stain on Bluebeard’s key, when
it is rubbed out on one side it reappears on the other. To
punish Socrates for his teaching, or for the way in which he
defended his teaching, was equally persecution, and persecution
of the worst description, that which attacks not the
results of free thought but free thought itself. We cannot
then agree with Grote when he says that the condemnation
of Socrates ‘ought to count as one of the least gloomy items
in an essentially gloomy catalogue.’ On the contrary, it is
the gloomiest of any, because it reveals a depth of hatred for
pure reason in vulgar minds which might otherwise have remained
unsuspected. There is some excuse for other persecutors,
for Caiaphas, and St. Dominic, and Calvin: for the Inquisition,
and for the authors of the dragonnades; for the
judges of Giordano Bruno, and the judges of Vanini: they
were striving to exterminate particular opinions, which they
believed to be both false and pernicious; there is no such
excuse for the Athenian dicasts, least of all for those eighty
who, having pronounced Socrates innocent, sentenced him to
death because he reasserted his innocence; if, indeed, innocence
be not too weak a word to describe his life-long battle
against that very irreligion and corruption which were laid to
his charge. Here, in this one cause, the great central issue
between two abstract principles, the principle of authority
and the principle of reason, was cleared from all adventitious
circumstances, and disputed on its own intrinsic merits with
the usual weapons of argument on the one side and brute
force on the other. On that issue Socrates was finally
condemned, and on it his judges must be condemned by
us.</p>

<p>Neither can we admit Grote’s further contention, that in
no Greek city but Athens would Socrates have been permitted
to carry on his cross-examining activity for so long a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
period. On the contrary, we agree with Colonel Mure,<a id="FNanchor_113_113" href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> that in
no other state would he have been molested. Xenophanes and
Parmenides, Heracleitus and Democritus, had given utterance
to far bolder opinions than his, opinions radically destructive
of Greek religion, apparently without running the slightest
personal risk; while Athens had more than once before
shown the same spirit of fanatical intolerance, though without
proceeding to such a fatal extreme, thanks, probably, to the
timely escape of her intended victims. M. Ernest Renan has
quite recently contrasted the freedom of thought accorded by
Roman despotism with the narrowness of old Greek Republicanism,
quoting what he calls the Athenian Inquisition as a
sample of the latter. The word inquisition is not too strong,
only the lecturer should not have led his audience to believe
that Greek Republicanism was in this respect fairly represented
by its most brilliant type, for had such been the case
very little free thought would have been left for Rome to
tolerate.</p>

<p>During the month’s respite accidentally allowed him,
Socrates had one more opportunity of displaying that stedfast
obedience to the law which had been one of his great guiding
principles through life. The means of escaping from prison
were offered to him, but he refused to avail himself of them,
according to Plato, that the implicit contract of loyalty to which
his citizenship had bound him might be preserved unbroken.
Nor was death unwelcome to him although it is not true that
he courted it, any desire to figure as a martyr being quite
alien from the noble simplicity of his character. But he had
reached an age when the daily growth in wisdom which for
him alone made life worth living, seemed likely to be exchanged
for a gradual and melancholy decline. That this
past progress was a good in itself he never doubted, whether
it was to be continued in other worlds, or succeeded by the
happiness of an eternal sleep. And we may be sure that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
would have held his own highest good to be equally desirable
for the whole human race, even with the clear prevision that
its collective aspirations and efforts cannot be prolonged for
ever.</p>

<p>Two philosophers only can be named who, in modern
times, have rivalled or approached the moral dignity of
Socrates. Like him, Spinoza realised his own ideal of a good
and happy life. Like him, Giordano Bruno, without a hope
of future recompense, chose death rather than a life unfaithful
to the highest truth, and death, too, under its most terrible
form, not the painless extinction by hemlock inflicted in a
heathen city, but the agonising dissolution intended by Catholic
love to serve as a foretaste of everlasting fire. Yet with
neither can the parallel be extended further; for Spinoza,
wisely perhaps, refused to face the storms which a public
profession and propagation of his doctrine would have raised;
and the wayward career of Giordano Bruno was not in keeping
with its heroic end. The complex and distracting conditions
in which their lot was cast did not permit them to attain that
statuesque completeness which marked the classic age of Greek
life and thought. Those times developed a wilder energy, a
more stubborn endurance, a sweeter purity than any that the
ancient world had known. But until the scattered elements
are recombined in a still loftier harmony, our sleepless thirst
for perfection can be satisfied at one spring alone. Pericles
must remain the ideal of statesmanship, Pheidias of artistic
production, and Socrates of philosophic power.</p>

<p>Before the ideas which we have passed in review could go
forth on their world-conquering mission, it was necessary, not
only that Socrates should die, but that his philosophy should
die also, by being absorbed into the more splendid generalisations
of Plato’s system. That system has, for some time
past, been made an object of close study in our most famous
seats of learning, and a certain acquaintance with it has
almost become part of a liberal education in England. No<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
better source of inspiration, combined with discipline, could
be found; but we shall understand and appreciate Plato still
better by first extricating the nucleus round which his speculations
have gathered in successive deposits, and this we can
only do with the help of Xenophon, whose little work also
well deserves attention for the sake of its own chaste and
candid beauty. The relation in which it stands to the
Platonic writings may be symbolised by an example familiar
to the experience of every traveller. As sometimes, in visiting
a Gothic cathedral, we are led through the wonders of the
more modern edifice—under soaring arches, over tesselated
pavements, and between long rows of clustered columns, past
frescoed walls, storied windows, carven pulpits, and sepulchral
monuments, with their endless wealth of mythologic imagery—down
into the oldest portion of any, the bare stern crypt,
severe with the simplicity of early art, resting on pillars taken
from an ancient temple, and enclosing the tomb of some
martyred saint, to whose glorified spirit an office of perpetual
intercession before the mercy-seat is assigned, and in whose
honour all that external magnificence has been piled up; so
also we pass through the manifold and marvellous constructions
of Plato’s imagination to that austere memorial where
Xenophon has enshrined with pious care, under the great
primary divisions of old Hellenic virtue, an authentic reliquary
of one standing foremost among those who, having worked
out their own deliverance from the powers of error and evil,
would not be saved alone, but published the secret of redemption
though death were the penalty of its disclosure; and
who, by their transmitted influence, even more than by their
eternal example, are still contributing to the progressive
development of all that is most rational, most consistent, most
social, and therefore most truly human in ourselves.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a><br />

<small>PLATO: HIS TEACHERS AND HIS TIMES.</small></h2>


<h3><a id="IV-I"></a>I.</h3>

<p>In studying the growth of philosophy as an historical evolution,
repetitions and anticipations must necessarily be of
frequent occurrence. Ideas meet us at every step which can
only be appreciated when we trace out their later developments,
or only understood when we refer them back to
earlier and half-forgotten modes of thought. The speculative
tissue is woven out of filaments so delicate and so complicated
that it is almost impossible to say where one begins and the
other ends. Even conceptions which seem to have been
transmitted without alteration are constantly acquiring a
new value according to the connexions into which they enter
or the circumstances to which they are applied. But if the
method of evolution, with its two great principles of continuity
and relativity, substitutes a maze of intricate lines,
often returning on themselves, for the straight path along
which progress was once supposed to move, we are more
than compensated by the new sense of coherence and
rationality where illusion and extravagance once seemed to
reign supreme. It teaches us that the dreams of a great
intellect may be better worth our attention than the waking
perceptions of ordinary men. Combining fragments of the
old order with rudimentary outlines of the new, they lay open
the secret laboratory of spiritual chemistry, and help to bridge
over the interval separating the most widely contrasted
phases of life and thought. Moreover, when we have once
accustomed ourselves to break up past systems of philosophy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
into their component elements, when we see how heterogeneous
and ill-cemented were the parts of this and that
proud edifice once offered as the only possible shelter against
dangers threatening the very existence of civilisation—we
shall be prepared for the application of a similar method to
contemporary systems of equally ambitious pretensions;
distinguishing that which is vital, fruitful, original, and progressive
in their ideal synthesis from that which is of merely
provisional and temporary value, when it is not the literary
resuscitation of a dead past, visionary, retrograde, and mischievously
wrong. And we shall also be reminded that the
most precious ideas have only been shaped, preserved, and
transmitted through association with earthy and perishable
ingredients. The function of true criticism is, like Robert
Browning’s Roman jeweller, to turn on them ‘the proper
fiery acid’ of purifying analysis which dissolves away the
inferior metal and leaves behind the gold ring whereby
thought and action are inseparably and fruitfully united.</p>

<p>Such, as it seems to us, is the proper spirit in which we
should approach the great thinker whose works are to occupy
us in this and the succeeding chapter. No philosopher has
ever offered so extended and vulnerable a front to hostile
criticism. None has so habitually provoked reprisals by his
own incessant and searching attacks on all existing professions,
customs, and beliefs. It might even be maintained that
none has used the weapons of controversy with more unscrupulous
zeal. And it might be added that he who dwells
so much on the importance of consistency has occasionally
denounced and ridiculed the very principles which he elsewhere
upholds as demonstrated truths. It was an easy
matter for others to complete the work of destruction which
he had begun. His system seems at first sight to be made
up of assertions, one more outrageous than another. The
ascription of an objective concrete separate reality to verbal
abstractions is assuredly the most astounding paradox ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
maintained even by a metaphysician. Yet this is the central
article of Plato’s creed. That body is essentially different
from extension might, one would suppose, have been sufficiently
clear to a mathematician who had the advantage of
coming after Leucippus and Democritus. Their identity is
implicitly affirmed in the <cite>Timaeus</cite>. That the soul cannot be
both created and eternal; that the doctrine of metempsychosis
is incompatible with the hereditary transmission of mental
qualities; that a future immortality equivalent to, and proved
by the same arguments as, our antenatal existence, would be
neither a terror to the guilty nor a consolation to the righteous:—are
propositions implicitly denied by Plato’s psychology.
Passing from theoretical to practical philosophy,
it might be observed that respect for human life, respect for
individual property, respect for marriage, and respect for
truthfulness, are generally numbered among the strongest
moral obligations, and those the observance of which most
completely distinguishes civilised from savage man; while
infanticide, communism, promiscuity, and the occasional employment
of deliberate deceit, form part of Plato’s scheme for
the redemption of mankind. We need not do more than
allude to those Dialogues where the phases and symptoms of
unnameable passion are delineated with matchless eloquence,
and apparently with at least as much sympathy as censure.
Finally, from the standpoint of modern science, it might be
urged that Plato used all his powerful influence to throw back
physical speculation into the theological stage; that he deliberately
discredited the doctrine of mechanical causation
which, for us, is the most important achievement of early Greek
thought; that he expatiated on the criminal folly of those
who held the heavenly bodies to be, what we now know them
to be, masses of dead matter with no special divinity about
them; and that he proposed to punish this and other heresies
with a severity distinguishable from the fitful fanaticism of his
native city only by its more disciplined and rigorous application.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span></p>

<p>A plain man might find it difficult to understand how
such extravagances could be deliberately propounded by the
greatest intellect that Athens ever produced, except on the
principle, dear to mediocrity, that genius is but little removed
from madness, and that philosophical genius resembles it
more nearly than any other. And his surprise would become
much greater on learning that the best and wisest men of all
ages have looked up with reverence to Plato; that thinkers
of the most opposite schools have resorted to him for instruction
and stimulation; that his writings have never been more
attentively studied than in our own age—an age which has
witnessed the destruction of so many illusive reputations; and
that the foremost of English educators has used all his
influence to promote the better understanding and appreciation
of Plato as a prime element in academic culture—an influence
now extended far beyond the limits of his own
university through that translation of the Platonic Dialogues
which is too well known to need any commendation on our
part, but which we may mention as one of the principal
authorities used for the present study, together with the work
of a German scholar, his obligations to whom Prof. Jowett
has acknowledged with characteristic grace.<a id="FNanchor_114_114" href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></p>

<p>As a set-off against the list of paradoxes cited from Plato,
it would be easy to quote a still longer list of brilliant contributions
to the cause of truth and right, to strike a balance
between the two, and to show that there was a preponderance
on the positive side sufficiently great to justify the favourable
verdict of posterity. We believe, however, that such a method
would be as misleading as it is superficial. Neither Plato
nor any other thinker of the same calibre—if any other there
be—should be estimated by a simple analysis of his opinions.
We must go back to the underlying forces of which individual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
opinions are the resultant and the revelation. Every systematic
synthesis represents certain profound intellectual tendencies,
derived partly from previous philosophies, partly from
the social environment, partly from the thinker’s own genius
and character. Each of such tendencies may be salutary and
necessary, according to the conditions under which it comes
into play, and yet two or more of them may form a highly
unstable and explosive compound. Nevertheless, it is in
speculative combinations that they are preserved and developed
with the greatest distinctness, and it is there that we must seek
for them if we would understand the psychological history of
our race. And this is why we began by intimating that the
lines of our investigation may take us back over ground which
has been already traversed, and forward into regions which
cannot at present be completely surveyed.</p>

<p>We have this great advantage in dealing with Plato—that
his philosophical writings have come down to us entire, while
the thinkers who preceded him are known only through
fragments and second-hand reports. Nor is the difference
merely accidental. Plato was the creator of speculative
literature, properly so called: he was the first and also the
greatest artist that ever clothed abstract thought in language of
appropriate majesty and splendour; and it is probably to
their beauty of form that we owe the preservation of his
writings. Rather unfortunately, however, along with the
genuine works of the master, a certain number of pieces have
been handed down to us under his name, of which some are
almost universally admitted to be spurious, while the authenticity
of others is a question on which the best scholars are
still divided. In the absence of any very cogent external
evidence, an immense amount of industry and learning has
been expended on this subject, and the arguments employed
on both sides sometimes make us doubt whether the reasoning
powers of philologists are better developed than, according
to Plato, were those of mathematicians in his time. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
two extreme positions are occupied by Grote, who accepts the
whole Alexandrian canon, and Krohn, who admits nothing but
the <cite>Republic</cite>;<a id="FNanchor_115_115" href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> while much more serious critics, such as
Schaarschmidt, reject along with a mass of worthless compositions
several Dialogues almost equal in interest and importance
to those whose authenticity has never been doubted.
The great historian of Greece seems to have been rather
undiscriminating both in his scepticism and in his belief; and
the exclusive importance which he attributed to contemporary
testimony, or to what passed for such with him, may have
unduly biassed his judgment in both directions. As it
happens, the authority of the canon is much weaker than
Grote imagined; but even granting his extreme contention,
our view of Plato’s philosophy would not be seriously affected
by it, for the pieces which are rejected by all other critics have
no speculative importance whatever. The case would be far
different were we to agree with those who impugn the
genuineness of the <cite>Parmenides</cite>, the <cite>Sophist</cite>, the <cite>Statesman</cite>,
the <cite>Philêbus</cite>, and the <cite>Laws</cite>; for these compositions mark a
new departure in Platonism amounting to a complete transformation
of its fundamental principles, which indeed is one
of the reasons why their authenticity has been denied.
Apart, however, from the numerous evidences of Platonic
authorship furnished by the Dialogues themselves, as well as
by the indirect references to them in Aristotle’s writings, it
seems utterly incredible that a thinker scarcely, if at all,
inferior to the master himself—as the supposed imitator must
assuredly have been—should have consented to let his
reasonings pass current under a false name, and that, too,
the name of one whose teaching he in some respects controverted;
while there is a further difficulty in assuming that
his existence could pass unnoticed at a period marked by
intense literary and philosophical activity. Readers who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
wish for fuller information on the subject will find in Zeller’s
pages a careful and lucid digest of the whole controversy
leading to a moderately conservative conclusion. Others will
doubtless be content to accept Prof. Jowett’s verdict, that
‘on the whole not a sixteenth part of the writings which
pass under the name of Plato, if we exclude the works
rejected by the ancients themselves, can be fairly doubted by
those who are willing to allow that a considerable change and
growth may have taken place in his philosophy.’<a id="FNanchor_116_116" href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> To which
we may add that the Platonic dialogues, whether the work
of one or more hands, and however widely differing among
themselves, together represent a single phase of thought, and
are appropriately studied as a connected series.</p>

<p>We have assumed in our last remark that it is possible to
discover some sort of chronological order in the Platonic
Dialogues, and to trace a certain progressive modification in
the general tenor of their teaching from first to last. But
here also the positive evidence is very scanty, and a variety
of conflicting theories have been propounded by eminent
scholars. Where so much is left to conjecture, the best that
can be said for any hypothesis is that it explains the facts
according to known laws of thought. It will be for the
reader to judge whether our own attempt to trace the gradual
evolution of Plato’s system satisfies this condition. In
making it we shall take as a basis the arrangement adopted
by Prof. Jowett, with some reservations hereafter to be
specified.</p>

<p>Before entering on our task, one more difficulty remains
to be noticed. Plato, although the greatest master of prose
composition that ever lived, and for his time a remarkably
voluminous author, cherished a strong dislike for books, and
even affected to regret that the art of writing had ever been
invented. A man, he said, might amuse himself by putting
down his ideas on paper, and might even find written<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
memoranda useful for private reference, but the only instruction
worth speaking of was conveyed by oral communication,
which made it possible for objections unforeseen by
the teacher to be freely urged and answered.<a id="FNanchor_117_117" href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> Such had
been the method of Socrates, and such was doubtless the
practice of Plato himself whenever it was possible for him to
set forth his philosophy by word of mouth. It has been
supposed, for this reason, that the great writer did not take
his own books in earnest, and wished them to be regarded as
no more than the elegant recreations of a leisure hour, while
his deeper and more serious thoughts were reserved for
lectures and conversations, of which, beyond a few allusions
in Aristotle, every record has perished. That such, however,
was not the case, may be easily shown. In the first place it
is evident, from the extreme pains taken by Plato to throw
his philosophical expositions into conversational form, that
he did not despair of providing a literary substitute for
spoken dialogue. Secondly, it is a strong confirmation of
this theory that Aristotle, a personal friend and pupil of
Plato during many years, should so frequently refer to the
Dialogues as authoritative evidences of his master’s opinions
on the most important topics. And, lastly, if it can be
shown that the documents in question do actually embody a
comprehensive and connected view of life and of the world,
we shall feel satisfied that the oral teaching of Plato, had it
been preserved, would not modify in any material degree the
impression conveyed by his written compositions.</p>


<h3><a id="IV-II"></a>II.</h3>

<p>There is a story that Plato used to thank the gods, in
what some might consider a rather Pharisaic spirit, for having
made him a human being instead of a brute, a man instead of
a woman, and a Greek instead of a barbarian; but more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
anything else for having permitted him to be born in the
time of Socrates. It will be observed that all these blessings
tended in one direction, the complete supremacy in his
character of reason over impulse and sense. To assert,
extend, and organise that supremacy was the object of his
whole life. Such, indeed, had been the object of all his
predecessors, and such, stated generally, has been always and
everywhere the object of philosophy; but none had pursued
it so consciously before, and none has proclaimed it so
enthusiastically since then. Now, although Plato could not
have done this without a far wider range of knowledge and
experience than Socrates had possessed, it was only by
virtue of the Socratic method that his other gifts and
acquisitions could be turned to complete account; while,
conversely, it was only when brought to bear upon these new
materials that the full power of the method itself could be
revealed. To be continually asking and answering questions;
to elicit information from everybody on every subject worth
knowing; and to elaborate the resulting mass of intellectual
material into the most convenient form for practical application
or for further transmission, was the secret of true wisdom
with the sage of the market-place and the workshop. But
the process of dialectic investigation as an end in itself, the
intense personal interest of conversation with living men and
women of all classes, the impatience for immediate and visible
results, had gradually induced Socrates to restrict within far
too narrow limits the sources whence his ideas were derived
and the purposes to which they were applied. And the
dialectic method itself could not but be checked in its internal
development by this want of breadth and variety in the
topics submitted to its grasp. Therefore the death of
Socrates, however lamentable in its occasion, was an unmixed
benefit to the cause for which he laboured, by arresting
(as we must suppose it to have arrested) the popular and
indiscriminate employment of his cross-examining method,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
liberating his ablest disciple from the ascendency of a revered
master, and inducing him to reconsider the whole question of
human knowledge and action from a remoter point of view.
For, be it observed that Plato did not begin where Socrates
had left off; he went back to the germinal point of the
whole system, and proceeded to reconstruct it on new lines
of his own. The loss of those whom we love habitually leads
our thoughts back to the time of our first acquaintance with
them, or, if these are ascertainable, to the circumstances of
their early life. In this manner Plato seems to have been at
first occupied exclusively with the starting-point of his
friend’s philosophy, and we know, from the narrative given in
the <cite>Apologia</cite>, under what form he came to conceive it. We
have attempted to show that the account alluded to cannot
be entirely historical. Nevertheless it seems sufficiently
clear that Socrates began with a conviction of his own
ignorance, and that his efforts to improve others were
prefaced by the extraction of a similar confession of ignorance
on their part. It is also certain that through life he regarded
the causes of physical phenomena as placed beyond the
reach of human reason and reserved by the gods for their
own exclusive cognisance, pointing, by way of proof, to the
notorious differences of opinion prevalent among those who
had meddled with such matters. Thus, his scepticism
worked in two directions, but on the one side it was only
provisional and on the other it was only partial. Plato began
by combining the two. He maintained that human nescience
is universal and necessary; that the gods had reserved all
knowledge for themselves; and that the only wisdom left
for men is a consciousness of their absolute ignorance. The
Socratic starting-point gave the centre of his agnostic circle;
the Socratic theology gave the distance at which it was
described. Here we have to note two things—first, the
breadth of generalisation which distinguishes the disciple
from the master; and, secondly, the symptoms of a strong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
religious reaction against Greek humanism. Even before the
end of the Peloponnesian War, evidence of this reaction had
appeared, and the <cite>Bacchae</cite> of Euripides bears striking
testimony to its gloomy and fanatical character. The last
agony of Athens, the collapse of her power, and the subsequent
period of oligarchic terrorism, must have given a
stimulus to superstition like that which quite recently
afflicted France with an epidemic of apparitions and pilgrimages
almost too childish for belief. Plato followed the
general movement, although on a much higher plane.
While looking down with undisguised contempt on the
immoral idolatry of his countrymen, he was equally opposed
to the irreligion of the New Learning, and, had an opportunity
been given him, he would, like the Reformers of the
sixteenth century, have put down both with impartial
severity. Nor was this the only analogy between his position
and that of a Luther or a Calvin. Like them, and indeed
like all great religious teachers, he exalted the Creator by
enlarging on the nothingness of the creature; just as Christianity
exhibits the holiness of God in contrast and correlation
with the sinfulness of unregenerate hearts; just as to Pindar
man’s life seemed but the fleeting shadow in a dream when
compared with the beauty and strength and immortality of
the Olympian divinities; so also did Plato deepen the gloom
of human ignorance that he might bring out in dazzling
relief the fulness of that knowledge which he had been
taught to prize as a supreme ideal, but which, for that very
reason, seemed proper to the highest existences alone. And
we shall presently see how Plato also discovered a principle
in man by virtue of which he could claim kindred with the
supernatural, and elaborated a scheme of intellectual mediation
by which the fallen spirit could be regenerated and made
a partaker in the kingdom of speculative truth.</p>

<p>Yet if Plato’s theology, from its predominantly rational
character, seemed to neglect some feelings which were better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
satisfied by the earlier or the later faiths of mankind, we
cannot say that it really excluded them. The unfading
strength of the old gods was comprehended in the self-existence
of absolute ideas, and moral goodness was only a
particular application of reason to the conduct of life. An
emotional or imaginative element was also contributed by
the theory that every faculty exercised without a reasoned
consciousness of its processes and aims was due to some
saving grace and inspiration from a superhuman power. It
was thus, according to Plato, that poets and artists were able
to produce works of which they were not able to render an
intelligent account; and it was thus that society continued to
hold together with such an exceedingly small amount of
wisdom and virtue. Here, however, we have to observe a
marked difference between the religious teachers pure and
simple, and the Greek philosopher who was a dialectician
even more than he was a divine. For Plato held that
providential government was merely provisional; that the
inspired prophet stood on a distinctly lower level than the
critical, self-conscious thinker; that ratiocination and not
poetry was the highest function of mind; and that action
should be reorganised in accordance with demonstrably
certain principles.<a id="FNanchor_118_118" href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">118</a></p>

<p>This search after a scientific basis for conduct was quite
in the spirit of Socrates, but Plato seems to have set very
little value on his master’s positive contributions to the systematisation
of life. We have seen that the <cite>Apologia</cite> is purely
sceptical in its tendency; and we find a whole group of Dialogues,
probably the earliest of Plato’s compositions, marked
by the same negative, inconclusive tone. These are commonly
spoken of as Socratic, and so no doubt they are in reference
to the subjects discussed; but they would be more accurately
described as an attempt to turn the Socratic method against
its first originator. We know from another source that tem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>perance,
fortitude, and piety were the chief virtues inculcated
and practised by Socrates; while friendship, if not strictly
speaking a virtue, was equally with them one of his prime
interests in life. It is clear that he considered them the most
appropriate and remunerative subjects of philosophical discussion;
that he could define their nature to his own satisfaction;
and that he had, in fact, defined them as so many varieties of
wisdom. Now, Plato has devoted a separate Dialogue to each
of the conceptions in question,<a id="FNanchor_119_119" href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> and in each instance he represents
Socrates, who is the principal spokesman, as professedly
ignorant of the whole subject under discussion, offering no
definition of his own (or at least none that he will stand by),
but asking his interlocutors for theirs, and pulling it to
pieces when it is given. We do, indeed, find a tendency
to resolve the virtues into knowledge, and, so far, either to
identify them with one another, or to carry them up into the
unity of a higher idea. To this extent Plato follows in the
footsteps of his master, but a result which had completely
satisfied Socrates became the starting-point of a new investigation
with his successor. If virtue is knowledge, it must be
knowledge of what we most desire—of the good. Thus the
original difficulty returns under another form, or rather we
have merely restated it in different terms. For, to ask what
is temperance or fortitude, is equivalent to asking what is its
use. And this was so obvious to Socrates, that, apparently, he
never thought of distinguishing between the two questions.
But no sooner were they distinguished than his reduction of all
morality to a single principle was shown to be illusive. For
each specific virtue had been substituted the knowledge of a
specific utility, and that was all. Unless the highest good
were one, the means by which it was sought could not converge
to a single point; nor, according to the new ideas,
could their mastery come under the jurisdiction of a single
art.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span></p>

<p>We may also suspect that Plato was dissatisfied not only
with the positive results obtained by Socrates, but also with
the Socratic method of constructing general definitions. To
rise from the part to the whole, from particular instances to
general notions, was a popular rather than a scientific process;
and sometimes it only amounted to taking the current explanations
and modifying them to suit the exigencies of ordinary
experience. The resulting definitions could never be more
than tentative, and a skilful dialectician could always upset
them by producing an unlooked-for exception, or by discovering
an ambiguity in the terms by which they were conveyed.</p>

<p>Before ascertaining in what direction Plato sought for an
outlet from these accumulated difficulties, we have to glance
at a Dialogue belonging apparently to his earliest compositions,
but in one respect occupying a position apart from the rest.
The <cite>Crito</cite> tells us for what reasons Socrates refused to escape
from the fate which awaited him in prison, as, with the assistance
of generous friends, he might easily have done. The
aged philosopher considered that by adopting such a course
he would be setting the Athenian laws at defiance, and doing
what in him lay to destroy their validity. Now, we know
that the historical Socrates held justice to consist in obedience
to the law of the land; and here for once we find Plato agreeing
with him on a definite and positive issue. Such a sudden
and singular abandonment of the sceptical attitude merits our
attention. It might, indeed, be said that Plato’s inconsistencies
defy all attempts at reconciliation, and that in this
instance the desire to set his maligned friend in a favourable
light triumphed over the claims of an impracticable logic.
We think, however, that a deeper and truer solution can be
found. If the <cite>Crito</cite> inculcates obedience to the laws as a
binding obligation, it is not for the reasons which, according
to Xenophon, were adduced by the real Socrates in his
dispute with the Sophist Hippias; general utility and private
interest were the sole grounds appealed to then. Plato, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
the other hand, ignores all such external considerations.
True to his usual method, he reduces the legal conscience to
a purely dialectical process. Just as in an argument the disputants
are, or ought to be, bound by their own admissions,
so also the citizen is bound by a tacit compact to fulfil the
laws whose protection he has enjoyed and of whose claims his
protracted residence is an acknowledgment. Here there is
no need of a transcendent foundation for morality, as none
but logical considerations come into play. And it also
deserves to be noticed that, where this very idea of an obligation
based on acceptance of services had been employed by
Socrates, it was discarded by Plato. In the <cite>Euthyphro</cite>, a
Dialogue devoted to the discussion of piety, the theory that
religion rests on an exchange of good offices between gods
and men is mentioned only to be scornfully rejected. Equally
remarkable, and equally in advance of the Socratic standpoint,
is a principle enunciated in the <cite>Crito</cite>, that retaliation is
wrong, and that evil should never be returned for evil.<a id="FNanchor_120_120" href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">120</a>
And both are distinct anticipations of the earliest Christian
teaching, though both are implicitly contradicted by the so-called
religious services celebrated in Christian churches and
by the doctrine of a divine retribution which is only not
retaliatory because it is infinitely in excess of the provocation
received.</p>

<p>If the earliest of Plato’s enquiries, while they deal with the
same subjects and are conducted on the same method as
those cultivated by Socrates, evince a breadth of view
surpassing anything recorded of him by Xenophon, they also
exhibit traces of an influence disconnected with and inferior
in value to his. On more than one occasion<a id="FNanchor_121_121" href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> Plato reasons,
or rather quibbles, in a style which he has elsewhere held up
to ridicule as characteristic of the Sophists, with such success
that the name of sophistry has clung to it ever since.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
Indeed, some of the verbal fallacies employed are so transparent
that we can hardly suppose them to be unintentional,
and we are forced to conclude that the young despiser of
human wisdom was resolved to maintain his thesis with any
weapons, good or bad, which came to hand. And it seems
much more likely that he learned the eristic art from
Protagoras or from his disciples than from Socrates. Plato
spent a large part of his life in opposing the Sophists—that
is to say, the paid professors of wisdom and virtue; but in
spite of, or rather perhaps because of, this very opposition, he
was profoundly affected by their teaching and example. It is
quite conceivable, although we do not find it stated as a fact,
that he resorted to them for instruction when a young man,
and before coming under the influence of Socrates, an event
which did not take place until he was twenty years old; or he
may have been directed to them by Socrates himself. With
all its originality, his style bears traces of a rhetorical
training in the more elaborate passages, and the Sophists
were the only teachers of rhetoric then to be found. His
habit of clothing philosophical lessons in the form of a myth
seems also to have been borrowed from them. It would,
therefore, not be surprising that he should cultivate their
argumentative legerdemain side by side with the more strict
and severe discipline of Socratic dialectics.</p>

<p>Plato does, no doubt, make it a charge against the
Sophists that their doctrines are not only false and immoral,
but that they are put together without any regard for logical
coherence. It would seem, however, that this style of attack
belongs rather to the later and constructive than to the
earlier and receptive period of his intellectual development.
The original cause of his antagonism to the professional
teachers seems to have been their general pretensions to
knowledge, which, from the standpoint of universal scepticism,
were, of course, utterly illusive; together with a feeling of
aristocratic contempt for a calling in which considerations of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
pecuniary interest were involved, heightened in this instance
by a conviction that the buyer received nothing better than a
sham article in exchange for his money. Here, again, a
parallel suggests itself with the first preaching of the Gospel.
The attitude of Christ towards the scribes and Pharisees, as
also that of St. Paul towards Simon Magus, will help us to
understand how Plato, in another order of spiritual teaching,
must have regarded the hypocrisy of wisdom, the intrusion
of fraudulent traders into the temple of Delphic inspiration,
and the sale of a priceless blessing whose unlimited diffusion
should have been its own and only reward.</p>

<p>Yet throughout the philosophy of Plato we meet with a
tendency to ambiguous shiftings and reversions of which, here
also, due account must be taken. That curious blending of
love and hate which forms the subject of a mystical lyric in
Mr. Browning’s <cite>Pippa Passes</cite>, is not without its counterpart
in purely rationalistic discussion. If Plato used the Socratic
method to dissolve away much that was untrue, because
incomplete, in Socratism, he used it also to absorb much that
was deserving of development in Sophisticism. If, in one
sense, the latter was a direct reversal of his master’s teaching,
in another it served as a sort of intermediary between that
teaching and the unenlightened consciousness of mankind.
The shadow should not be confounded with the substance,
but it might show by contiguity, by resemblance, and by
contrast where the solid reality lay, what were its outlines,
and how its characteristic lights might best be viewed.</p>

<p>Such is the mild and conciliatory mode of treatment at
first adopted by Plato in dealing with the principal representative
of the Sophists—Protagoras. In the Dialogue which
bears his name the famous humanist is presented to us as a
professor of popular unsystematised morality, proving by a
variety of practical arguments and ingenious illustrations that
virtue can be taught, and that the preservation of social order
depends upon the possibility of teaching it; but unwilling to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
go along with the reasonings by which Socrates shows the
applicability of rigorously scientific principles to conduct.
Plato has here taken up one side of the Socratic ethics, and
developed it into a complete and self-consistent theory. The
doctrine inculcated is that form of utilitarianism to which Mr.
Sidgwick has given the name of egoistic hedonism. We are
brought to admit that virtue is one because the various
virtues reduce themselves in the last analysis to prudence.
It is assumed that happiness, in the sense of pleasure and the
absence of pain, is the sole end of life. Duty is identified
with interest. Morality is a calculus for computing quantities
of pleasure and pain, and all virtuous action is a means for
securing a maximum of the one together with a minimum of
the other. Ethical science is constituted; it can be taught
like mathematics; and so far the Sophists are right, but they
have arrived at the truth by a purely empirical process; while
Socrates, who professes to know nothing, by simply following
the dialectic impulse strikes out a generalisation which at once
confirms and explains their position; yet from self-sufficiency
or prejudice they refuse to agree with him in taking their
stand on its only logical foundation.</p>

<p>That Plato put forward the ethical theory of the Protagoras
in perfect good faith cannot, we think, be doubted; although
in other writings he has repudiated hedonism with contemptuous
aversion; and it seems equally evident that this was his
earliest contribution to positive thought. Of all his theories
it is the simplest and most Socratic; for Socrates, in endeavouring
to reclaim the foolish or vicious, often spoke as if
self-interest was the paramount principle of human nature;
although, had his assumption been formulated as an abstract
proposition, he too might have shrunk from it with something
of the uneasiness attributed to Protagoras. And from internal
evidence of another description we have reason to think that
the Dialogue in question is a comparatively juvenile production,
remembering always that the period of youth was much more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
protracted among the Greeks than among ourselves. One
almost seems to recognise the hand of a boy just out of
college, who delights in drawing caricatures of his teachers;
and who, while he looks down on classical scholarship in comparison
with more living and practical topics, is not sorry to
show that he can discuss a difficult passage from Simonides
better than the professors themselves.</p>


<h3><a id="IV-III"></a>III.</h3>

<p>Our survey of Plato’s first period is now complete; and we
have to enter on the far more arduous task of tracing out the
circumstances, impulses, and ideas by which all the scattered
materials of Greek life, Greek art, and Greek thought were
shaped into a new system and stamped with the impress of
an imperishable genius. At the threshold of this second
period the personality of Plato himself emerges into greater
distinctness, and we have to consider what part it played in
an evolution where universal tendencies and individual leanings
were inseparably combined.</p>

<p>Plato was born in the year 429, or according to some
accounts 427, and died 347 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> Few incidents in his biography
can be fixed with any certainty; but for our purpose the
most general facts are also the most interesting, and about
these we have tolerably trustworthy information. His family
was one of the noblest in Athens, being connected on the
father’s side with Codrus, and on the mother’s with Solon;
while two of his kinsmen, Critias and Charmides, were among
the chiefs of the oligarchic party. It is uncertain whether he
inherited any considerable property, nor is the question one of
much importance. It seems clear that he enjoyed the best
education Athens could afford, and that through life he possessed
a competence sufficient to relieve him from the cares of
material existence. Possibly the preference which he expressed,
when far advanced in life, for moderate health and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
wealth arose from having experienced those advantages himself.
If the busts which bear his name are to be trusted, he
was remarkably beautiful, and, like some other philosophers,
very careful of his personal appearance. Perhaps some
reminiscences of the admiration bestowed on himself may be
mingled with those pictures of youthful loveliness and of its
exciting effect on the imaginations of older men which give
such grace and animation to his earliest dialogues. We know
not whether as lover or beloved he passed unscathed through
the storms of passion which he has so powerfully described,
nor whether his apparently intimate acquaintance with them
is due to divination or to regretful experience. We may pass
by in silence whatever is related on this subject, with the certainty
that, whether true or not, scandalous stories could not
fail to be circulated about him.</p>

<p>It was natural that one who united a great intellect to a
glowing temperament should turn his thoughts to poetry.
Plato wrote a quantity of verses—verse-making had become
fashionable just then—but wisely committed them to the
flames on making the acquaintance of Socrates. It may well
be doubted whether the author of the <cite>Phaedrus</cite> and the
<cite>Symposium</cite> would ever have attained eminence in metrical
composition, even had he lived in an age far more favourable
to poetic inspiration than that which came after the flowering
time of Attic art. It seems as if Plato, with all his fervour,
fancy, and dramatic skill, lacked the most essential quality of
a singer; his finest passages are on a level with the highest
poetry, and yet they are separated from it by a chasm more
easily felt than described. Aristotle, whom we think of as
hard and dry and cold, sometimes comes much nearer to the
true lyric cry. And, as if to mark out Plato’s style still more
distinctly from every other, it is also deficient in oratorical
power. The philosopher evidently thought that he could beat
the rhetoricians on their own ground; if the <cite>Menexenus</cite> be
genuine, he tried to do so and failed; and even without its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
testimony we are entitled to say as much on the strength of
shorter attempts. We must even take leave to doubt whether
dialogue, properly so called, was Plato’s forte. Where one
speaker is placed at such a height above the others as Socrates,
or the Eleatic Stranger, or the Athenian in the <cite>Laws</cite>, there
cannot be any real conversation. The other interlocutors are
good listeners, and serve to break the monotony of a continuous
exposition by their expressions of assent or even by
their occasional inability to follow the argument, but give no
real help or stimulus. And when allowed to offer an opinion
of their own, they, too, lapse into a monologue, addressed, as
our silent trains of thought habitually are, to an imaginary
auditor whose sympathy and support are necessary but are
also secure. Yet if Plato’s style is neither exactly poetical,
nor oratorical, nor conversational, it has affinities with each of
these three varieties; it represents the common root from
which they spring, and brings us, better than any other species
of composition, into immediate contact with the mind of the
writer. The Platonic Socrates has eyes like those of a portrait
which follow us wherever we turn, and through which
we can read his inmost soul, which is no other than the universal
reason of humanity in the delighted surprise of its first
awakening to self-conscious activity. The poet thinks and
feels for us; the orator makes our thoughts and feelings his
own, and then restores them to us in a concentrated form,
‘receiving in vapour what he gives back in a flood.’ Plato
removes every obstacle to the free development of our faculties;
he teaches us by his own example how to think and to feel
for ourselves. If Socrates personified philosophy, Plato has
reproduced the personification in artistic form with such
masterly effect that its influence has been extended through
all ages and over the whole civilised world. This portrait
stands as an intermediary between its original and the far-reaching
effects indirectly due to his dialectic inspiration, like
that universal soul which Plato himself has placed between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
the supreme artificer and the material world, that it might
bring the fleeting contents of space and time into harmony
with uncreated and everlasting ideas.</p>

<p>To paint Socrates at his highest and his best, it was necessary
to break through the narrow limits of his historic individuality,
and to show how, had they been presented to him, he
would have dealt with problems outside the experience of
a home-staying Athenian citizen. The founder of idealism—that
is to say, the realisation of reason, the systematic application
of thought to life—had succeeded in his task because he
had embodied the noblest elements of the Athenian Dêmos,
orderliness, patriotism, self-control, and publicity of debate,
together with a receptive intelligence for improvements effected
in other states. But, just as the impulse which enabled those
qualities to tell decisively on Greek history at a moment of
inestimable importance came from the Athenian aristocracy,
with its Dorian sympathies, its adventurous ambition, and its
keen attention to foreign affairs, so also did Plato, carrying
the same spirit into philosophy, bring the dialectic method
into contact with older and broader currents of speculation,
and employ it to recognise the whole spiritual activity of his
race.</p>

<p>A strong desire for reform must always be preceded by a
deep dissatisfaction with things as they are; and if the reform
is to be very sweeping the discontent must be equally comprehensive.
Hence the great renovators of human life have
been remarkable for the severity with which they have
denounced the failings of the world where they were placed,
whether as regards persons, habits, institutions, or beliefs. Yet
to speak of their attitude as pessimistic would either be unfair,
or would betray an unpardonable inability to discriminate
between two utterly different theories of existence. Nothing
can well be more unlike the systematised pusillanimity of
those lost souls, without courage and without hope, who find
a consolation for their own failure in the belief that everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
is a failure, than the fiery energy which is drawn into a perpetual
tension by the contrast of what is with the vision of
what yet may be. But if pessimism paralyses every generous
effort and aspiration by teaching that misery is the irremediable
lot of animated beings, or even, in the last analysis, of all
being, the opposing theory of optimism exercises as deadly
an influence when it induces men to believe that their present
condition is, on the whole, a satisfactory one, or that at
worst wrong will be righted without any criticism or interference
on their part. Even those who believe progress to
have been, so far, the most certain fact in human history, cannot
blind themselves to the existence of enormous forces ever
tending to draw society back into the barbarism and brutality
of its primitive condition; and they know also, that whatever
ground we have won is due to the efforts of a small minority,
who were never weary of urging forward their more sluggish
companions, without caring what angry susceptibilities they
might arouse—risking recrimination, insult, and outrage, so
that only, under whatever form, whether of divine mandate
or of scientific demonstration, the message of humanity to her
children might be delivered in time. Nor is it only with
immobility that they have had to contend. Gains in one
direction are frequently balanced by losses in another; while
at certain periods there is a distinct retrogression along the
whole line. And it is well if, amid the general decline to a
lower level, sinister voices are not heard proclaiming that the
multitude may safely trust to their own promptings, and that
self-indulgence or self-will should be the only law of life. It
is also on such occasions that the rallying cry is most needed,
and that the born leaders of civilisation must put forth their
most strenuous efforts to arrest the disheartened fugitives
and to denounce the treacherous guides. It was in this
aspect that Plato viewed his age; and he set himself to continue
the task which Socrates had attempted, but had been
trampled down in endeavouring to achieve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span></p>

<p>The illustrious Italian poet and essayist, Leopardi, has
observed that the idea of the world as a vast confederacy
banded together for the repression of everything good and
great and true, originated with Jesus Christ.<a id="FNanchor_122_122" href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> It is surprising
that so accomplished a Hellenist should not have attributed
the priority to Plato. It is true that he does not speak of
the world itself in Leopardi’s sense, because to him it meant
something different—a divinely created order which it would
have been blasphemy to revile; but the thing is everywhere
present to his thoughts under other names, and he pursues it
with relentless hostility. He looks on the great majority of
the human race, individually and socially, in their beliefs and
in their practices, as utterly corrupt, and blinded to such an
extent that they are ready to turn and rend any one who
attempts to lead them into a better path. The many ‘know
not wisdom and virtue, and are always busy with gluttony
and sensuality. Like cattle, with their eyes always looking
down and their heads stooping, not, indeed, to the earth, but
to the dining-table, they fatten and feed and breed, and in
their excessive love of these delights they kick and butt at
one another with horns and hoofs which are made of iron;
and they kill one another by reason of their insatiable lust.’<a id="FNanchor_123_123" href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">123</a>
Their ideal is the man who nurses up his desires to the utmost
intensity, and procures the means for gratifying them by
fraud or violence. The assembled multitude resembles a
strong and fierce brute expressing its wishes by inarticulate
grunts, which the popular leaders make it their business to
understand and to comply with.<span class="ref"><a href="#J">J</a></span> A statesman of the nobler
kind who should attempt to benefit the people by thwarting
their foolish appetites will be denounced as a public enemy
by the demagogues, and will stand no more chance of acquittal
than a physician if he were brought before a jury of children
by the pastry-cook.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span></p>

<p>That an Athenian, or, indeed, any Greek gentleman,
should regard the common people with contempt and aversion
was nothing strange. A generation earlier such feelings
would have led Plato to look on the overthrow of democracy
and the establishment of an aristocratic government as the
remedy for every evil. The upper classes, accustomed to
decorate themselves with complimentary titles, had actually
come to believe that all who belonged to them were paragons
of wisdom and goodness. With the rule of the Thirty came
a terrible awakening. In a few months more atrocities were
perpetrated by the oligarchs than the Dêmos had been guilty
of in as many generations. It was shown that accomplished
gentlemen like Critias were only distinguished from the
common herd by their greater impatience of opposition and
by the more destructive fury of their appetites. With Plato,
at least, all allusions on this head came to an end. He now
‘smiled at the claims of long descent,’ considering that ‘every
man has had thousands and thousands of progenitors, and
among them have been rich and poor, kings and slaves,
Hellenes and barbarians, many times over;’ and even the
possession of a large landed property ceased to inspire him
with any respect when he compared it with the surface of the
whole earth.<span class="ref"><a href="#K">K</a></span></p>

<p>There still remained one form of government to be tried,
the despotic rule of a single individual. In the course of his
travels Plato came into contact with an able and powerful
specimen of the tyrant class, the elder Dionysius. A number
of stories relating to their intercourse have been preserved;
but the different versions disagree very widely, and none of
them can be entirely trusted. It seems certain, however,
that Plato gave great offence to the tyrant by his freedom of
speech, that he narrowly escaped death, and that he was sold
into slavery, from which condition he was redeemed by the
generosity of Anniceris, a Cyrenaean philosopher. It is
supposed that the scathing description in which Plato has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
held up to everlasting infamy the unworthy possessor of
absolute power—a description long afterwards applied by
Tacitus to the vilest of the Roman emperors—was suggested
by the type which had come under his own observation in
Sicily.</p>

<p>Of all existing constitutions that of Sparta approached
nearest to the ideal of Plato, or, rather, he regarded it as the
least degraded. He liked the conservatism of the Spartans,
their rigid discipline, their haughty courage, the participation
of their daughters in gymnastic exercises, the austerity of
their manners, and their respect for old age; but he found
much to censure both in their ancient customs and in the
characteristics which the possession of empire had recently
developed among them. He speaks with disapproval of
their exclusively military organisation, of their contempt for
philosophy, and of the open sanction which they gave to
practices barely tolerated at Athens. And he also comments
on their covetousness, their harshness to inferiors, and their
haste to throw off the restraints of the law whenever detection
could be evaded.<a id="FNanchor_124_124" href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">124</a></p>

<p>So far we have spoken as if Plato regarded the various
false polities existing around him as so many fixed and disconnected
types. This, however, was not the case. The
present state of things was bad enough, but it threatened to
become worse wherever worse was possible. The constitutions
exhibiting a mixture of good and evil contained within
themselves the seeds of a further corruption, and tended to
pass into the form standing next in order on the downward
slope. Spartan timocracy must in time become an oligarchy,
to oligarchy would succeed democracy, and this would end in
tyranny, beyond which no further fall was possible.<a id="FNanchor_125_125" href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> The
degraded condition of Syracuse seemed likely to be the last
outcome of Hellenic civilisation. We know not how far the
gloomy forebodings of Plato may have been justified by his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
own experience, but he sketched with prophetic insight the
future fortunes of the Roman Republic. Every phase of the
progressive degeneration is exemplified in its later history,
and the order of their succession is most faithfully preserved.
Even his portraits of individual timocrats, oligarchs, demagogues,
and despots are reproduced to the life in the pages of
Plutarch, of Cicero, and of Tacitus.</p>

<p>If our critic found so little to admire in Hellas, still less
did he seek for the realisation of his dreams in the outlying
world. The lessons of Protagoras had not been wasted on
him, and, unlike the nature-worshippers of the eighteenth
century, he never fell into the delusion that wisdom and virtue
had their home in primaeval forests or in corrupt Oriental
despotisms. For him, Greek civilisation, with all its faults,
was the best thing that human nature had produced, the only
hearth of intellectual culture, the only soil where new experiments
in education and government could be tried. He
could go down to the roots of thought, of language, and of
society; he could construct a new style, a new system, and a
new polity, from the foundation up; he could grasp all the
tendencies that came under his immediate observation, and
follow them out to their utmost possibilities of expansion;
but his vast powers of analysis and generalisation remained
subject to this restriction, that a Hellene he was and a Hellene
he remained to the end.</p>

<p>A Hellene, and an aristocrat as well. Or, using the word
in its most comprehensive sense, we may say that he was an
aristocrat all round, a believer in inherent superiorities of
race, sex, birth, breeding, and age. Everywhere we find him
restlessly searching after the wisest, purest, best, until at last,
passing beyond the limits of existence itself, words fail him
to describe the absolute ineffable only good, not being and
not knowledge, but creating and inspiring both. Thus it
came to pass that his hopes of effecting a thorough reform
did not lie in an appeal to the masses, but in the selection and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
seclusion from evil influences of a few intelligent youths.
Here we may detect a remarkable divergence between him
and his master. Socrates, himself a man of the people, did
not like to hear the Athenians abused. If they went wrong,
it was, he said, the fault of their leaders.<a id="FNanchor_126_126" href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> But according to
Plato, it was from the people themselves that corruption
originally proceeded, it was they who instilled false lessons
into the most intelligent minds, teaching them from their very
infancy to prefer show to substance, success to merit, and
pleasure to virtue; making the study of popular caprice the
sure road to power, and poisoning the very sources of morality
by circulating blasphemous stories about the gods—stories
which represented them as weak, sensual, capricious beings,
setting an example of iniquity themselves, and quite willing
to pardon it in men on condition of going shares in the spoil.
The poets had a great deal to do with the manufacture of
these discreditable myths; and towards poets as a class Plato
entertained feelings of mingled admiration and contempt.
As an artist, he was powerfully attracted by the beauty of
their works; as a theologian, he believed them to be the
channels of divine inspiration, and sometimes also the
guardians of a sacred tradition; but as a critic, he was shocked
at their incapacity to explain the meaning of their own works,
especially when it was coupled with ridiculous pretensions to
omniscience; and he regarded the imitative character of their
productions as illustrating, in a particularly flagrant manner,
that substitution of appearance for reality which, according to
his philosophy, was the deepest source of error and evil.</p>

<p>If private society exercised a demoralising influence on its
most gifted members, and in turn suffered a still further
debasement by listening to their opinions, the same fatal
interchange of corruption went on still more actively in public
life, so far, at least, as Athenian democracy was concerned.
The people would tolerate no statesman who did not pamper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
their appetites; and the statesmen, for their own ambitious
purposes, attended solely to the material wants of the people,
entirely neglecting their spiritual interests. In this respect,
Pericles, the most admired of all, had been the chief of
sinners; for ‘he was the first who gave the people pay and
made them idle and cowardly, and encouraged them in the
love of talk and of money.’ Accordingly, a righteous retribution
overtook him, for ‘at the very end of his life they convicted
him of theft, and almost put him to death.’ So it had
been with the other boasted leaders, Miltiades, Themistocles,
and Cimon; all suffered from what is falsely called the
ingratitude of the people. Like injudicious keepers, they had
made the animal committed to their charge fiercer instead of
gentler, until its savage propensities were turned against
themselves. Or, changing the comparison, they were like
purveyors of luxury, who fed the State on a diet to which its
present ‘ulcerated and swollen condition’ was due. They
had ‘filled the city full of harbours, and docks, and walls, and
revenues and all that, and had left no room for justice and
temperance.’ One only among the elder statesmen, Aristeides,
is excepted from this sweeping condemnation, and, similarly,
Socrates is declared to have been the only true statesman of
his time.<a id="FNanchor_127_127" href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">127</a></p>

<p>On turning from the conduct of State affairs to the
administration of justice in the popular law courts, we find
the same tale of iniquity repeated, but this time with more
telling satire, as Plato is speaking from his own immediate
experience. He considers that, under the manipulation of
dexterous pleaders, judicial decisions had come to be framed
with a total disregard of righteousness. That disputed claims
should be submitted to a popular tribunal and settled by
counting heads was, indeed, according to his view, a
virtual admission that no absolute standard of justice existed;
that moral truth varied with individual opinion. And this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
is how the character of the lawyer had been moulded in
consequence:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>He has become keen and shrewd; he has learned how to flatter
his master in word and indulge him in deed; but his soul is small
and unrighteous. His slavish condition has deprived him of growth
and uprightness and independence; dangers and fears which were
too much for his truth and honesty came upon him in early years,
when the tenderness of youth was unequal to them, and he has been
driven into crooked ways; from the first he has practised deception
and retaliation, and has become stunted and warped. And so he
has passed out of youth into manhood, having no soundness in him,
and is now, as he thinks, a master in wisdom.<a id="FNanchor_128_128" href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">128</a></p></blockquote>

<p>To make matters worse, the original of this unflattering
portrait was rapidly becoming the most powerful man in the
State. Increasing specialisation had completely separated
the military and political functions which had formerly been
discharged by a single eminent individual, and the business
of legislation was also becoming a distinct profession. No
orator could obtain a hearing in the assembly who had not a
technical acquaintance with the subject of deliberation, if it
admitted of technical treatment, which was much more frequently
the case now than in the preceding generation. As
a consequence of this revolution, the ultimate power of
supervision and control was passing into the hands of the
law courts, where general questions could be discussed in a
more popular style, and often from a wider or a more sentimental
point of view. They were, in fact, beginning to wield
an authority like that exercised until quite lately by the
press in modern Europe, only that its action was much more
direct and formidable. A vote of the Ecclêsia could only
deprive a statesman of office: a vote of the Dicastery might
deprive him of civil rights, home, freedom, property, or even
life itself. Moreover, with the loss of empire and the decline
of public spirit, private interests had come to attract a
proportionately larger share of attention; and unobtrusive citi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>zens
who had formerly escaped from the storms of party
passion, now found themselves marked out as a prey by every
fluent and dexterous pleader who could find an excuse for
dragging them before the courts. Rhetoric was hailed as the
supreme art, enabling its possessor to dispense with every
other study, and promising young men were encouraged to
look on it as the most paying line they could take up. Even
those whose civil status or natural timidity precluded them
from speaking in public could gain an eminent and envied
position by composing speeches for others to deliver. Behind
these, again, stood the professed masters of rhetoric, claiming
to direct the education and the whole public opinion of
the age by their lectures and pamphlets. Philosophy was
not excluded from their system of training, but it occupied a
strictly subordinate place. Studied in moderation, they
looked on it as a bracing mental exercise and a repertory
of sounding commonplaces, if not as a solvent for old-fashioned
notions of honesty; but a close adherence to the
laws of logic or to the principles of morality seemed puerile
pedantry to the elegant stylists who made themselves the
advocates of every crowned filibuster abroad, while preaching
a policy of peace at any price at home.</p>

<p>It is evident that the fate of Socrates was constantly in
Plato’s thoughts, and greatly embittered his scorn for the multitude
as well as for those who made themselves its ministers
and minions. It so happened that his friend’s three accusers
had been respectively a poet, a statesman, and a rhetor; thus
aptly typifying to the philosopher’s lively imagination the
triad of charlatans in whom public opinion found its appropriate
representatives and spokesmen. Yet Plato ought
consistently to have held that the condemnation of Socrates
was, equally with the persecution of Pericles, a satire on the
teaching which, after at least thirty years’ exercise, had left
its auditors more corrupt than it found them. In like manner
the ostracism of Aristeides might be set against similar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
sentences passed on less puritanical statesmen. For the
purpose of the argument it would have been sufficient to
show that in existing circumstances the office of public
adviser was both thankless and dangerous. We must always
remember that when Plato is speaking of past times he is
profoundly influenced by aristocratic traditions, and also that
under a retrospective disguise he is really attacking contemporary
abuses. And if, even then, his denunciations seem
excessive, their justification may be found in that continued
decay of public virtue which, not long afterwards, brought
about the final catastrophe of Athenian independence.</p>


<h3><a id="IV-IV"></a>IV.</h3>

<p>To illustrate the relation in which Plato stood towards his
own times, we have already had occasion to draw largely on
the productions of his maturer manhood. We have now to
take up the broken thread of our systematic exposition, and
to trace the development of his philosophy through that
wonderful series of compositions which entitle him to rank
among the greatest writers, the most comprehensive thinkers,
and the purest religious teachers of all ages. In the presence
of such glory a mere divergence of opinion must not be
permitted to influence our judgment. High above all particular
truths stands the principle that truth itself exists, and it
was for this that Plato fought. If there were others more
completely emancipated from superstition, none so persistently
appealed to the logic before which superstition must
ultimately vanish. If his schemes for the reconstruction of
society ignore many obvious facts, they assert with unrivalled
force the necessary supremacy of public welfare over private
pleasure; and their avowed utilitarianism offers a common
ground to the rival reformers who will have nothing to do
with the mysticism of their metaphysical foundation. Those,
again, who hold, like the youthful Plato himself, that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
ultimate interpretation of existence belongs to a science
transcending human reason, will here find the doctrines of
their religion anticipated as in a dream. And even those
who, standing aloof both from theology and philosophy, live,
as they imagine, for beauty alone, will observe with interest
how the spirit of Greek art survived in the denunciation of its
idolatry, and ‘the light that never was on sea or land,’ after
fading away from the lower levels of Athenian fancy, came
once more to suffuse the frozen steeps of dialectic with its
latest and divinest rays.</p>

<p>The glowing enthusiasm of Plato is, however, not entirely
derived from the poetic traditions of his native city; or
perhaps we should rather say that he and the great writers
who preceded him drew from a common fount of inspiration.
Mr. Emerson, in one of the most penetrating criticisms ever
written on our philosopher,<a id="FNanchor_129_129" href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> has pointed out the existence of
two distinct elements in the Platonic Dialogues—one dispersive,
practical, prosaic; the other mystical, absorbing, centripetal.
The American scholar is, however, as we think, quite
mistaken when he attributes the second of these tendencies to
Asiatic influence. It is extremely doubtful whether Plato
ever travelled farther east than Egypt; it is probable that
his stay in that country was not of long duration; and it is
certain that he did not acquire a single metaphysical idea
from its inhabitants. He liked their rigid conservatism; he
liked their institution of a dominant priesthood; he liked
their system of popular education, and the place which it
gave to mathematics made him look with shame on the
‘swinish ignorance’ of his own countrymen in that respect;<a id="FNanchor_130_130" href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">130</a>
but on the whole he classes them among the races exclusively
devoted to money-making, and in aptitude for philosophy he
places them far below the Greeks. Very different were the
impressions brought home from his visits to Sicily and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
Southern Italy. There he became acquainted with modes of
thought in which the search after hidden resemblances and
analogies was a predominant passion; there the existence of
a central unity underlying all phenomena was maintained,
as against sense and common opinion, with the intensity of a
religious creed; there alone speculation was clothed in poetic
language; there first had an attempt been made to carry
thought into life by associating it with a reform of manners
and beliefs. There, too, the arts of dance and song had
assumed a more orderly and solemn aspect; the chorus
received its final constitution from a Sicilian master; and the
loftiest strains of Greek lyric poetry were composed for recitation
in the streets of Sicilian cities or at the courts of
Sicilian kings. Then, with the rise of rhetoric, Greek prose
was elaborated by Sicilian teachers into a sort of rhythmical
composition, combining rich imagery with studied harmonies
and contrasts of sense and sound. And as the hold of
Asiatic civilisation on eastern Hellas grew weaker, the attention
of her foremost spirits was more and more attracted to
this new region of wonder and romance. The stream of
colonisation set thither in a steady flow; the scenes of
mythical adventure were rediscovered in Western waters; and
it was imagined that, by grasping the resources of Sicily, an
empire extending over the whole Mediterranean might be
won. Perhaps, without being too fanciful, we may trace a
likeness between the daring schemes of Alcibiades and the
more remote but not more visionary kingdom suggested by
an analogous inspiration to the idealising soul of Plato.
Each had learned to practise, although for far different
purposes, the royal art of Socrates—the mastery over men’s
minds acquired by a close study of their interests, passions,
and beliefs. But the ambition of the one defeated his own
aim, to the destruction of his country and of himself; while
the other drew into Athenian thought whatever of Western
force and fervour was needed for the accomplishment of its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
imperial task. We may say of Plato what he has said of his
own Theaetêtus, that ‘he moves surely and smoothly and
successfully in the path of knowledge and inquiry; always
making progress like the noiseless flow of a river of oil’;<a id="FNanchor_131_131" href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> but
everywhere beside or beneath that placid lubricating flow we
may trace the action of another current, where still sparkles,
fresh and clear as at first, the fiery Sicilian wine.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that in an earlier section of this
chapter we accompanied Plato to a period when he had
provisionally adopted a theory in which the Protagorean
contention that virtue can be taught was confirmed and
explained by the Socratic contention that virtue is knowledge;
while this knowledge again was interpreted in the
sense of a hedonistic calculus, a prevision and comparison of
the pleasures and pains consequent on our actions. We have
now to trace the lines of thought by which he was guided to
a different conception of ethical science.</p>

<p>After resolving virtue into knowledge of pleasure, the
next questions which would present themselves to so keen a
thinker were obviously, What is knowledge? and What is
pleasure? The <cite>Theaetêtus</cite> is chiefly occupied with a discussion
of the various answers already given to the first of these
enquiries. It seems, therefore, to come naturally next after
the <cite>Protagoras</cite>; and our conjecture receives a further confirmation
when we find that here also a large place is given
to the opinions of the Sophist after whom that dialogue is
named; the chief difference being that the points selected for
controversy are of a speculative rather than of a practical
character. There is, however, a close connexion between the
argument by which Protagoras had endeavoured to prove that all
mankind are teachers of virtue, and his more general principle
that man is the measure of all things. And perhaps it was
the more obvious difficulties attending the latter view which
led Plato, after some hesitation, to reject the former along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
with it. In an earlier chapter we gave some reasons for
believing that Protagoras did not erect every individual into
an arbiter of truth in the sweeping sense afterwards put upon
his words. He was probably opposing a human to a theological
or a naturalistic standard. Nevertheless, it does not
follow that Plato was fighting with a shadow when he
pressed the Protagorean dictum to its most literal interpretation.
There are plenty of people still who would maintain it
to that extent. Wherever and whenever the authority of
ancient traditions is broken down, the doctrine that one
man’s opinion is as good as another’s immediately takes its
place; or rather the doctrine in question is a survival of
traditionalism in an extremely pulverised form. And when
we are told that the majority must be right—which is a very
different principle from holding that the majority should be
obeyed—we may take it as a sign that the loose particles
are beginning to coalesce again. The substitution of an
individual for a universal standard of truth is, according to
Plato, a direct consequence of the theory which identifies
knowledge with sense-perception. It is, at any rate, certain
that the most vehement assertors of the former doctrine are
also those who are fondest of appealing to what they and
their friends have seen, heard, or felt; and the more educated
among them place enormous confidence in statistics.
They are also fond of repeating the adage that an ounce
of fact is worth a ton of theory, without considering that
theory alone can furnish the balance in which facts are
weighed. Plato does not go very deep into the <em>rationale</em> of
observation, nor in the infancy of exact science was it to be
expected that he should. He fully recognised the presence
of two factors, an objective and a subjective, in every sensation,
but lost his hold on the true method in attempting to
trace a like dualism through the whole of consciousness.
Where we should distinguish between the mental energies
and the physical processes underlying them, or between the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
elements respectively contributed to every cognition by
immediate experience and reflection, he conceived the inner
and outer worlds as two analogous series related to one
another as an image to its original.</p>

<p>At this last point we touch on the final generalisation by
which Plato extended the dialectic method to all existence,
and readmitted into philosophy the earlier speculations
provisionally excluded from it by Socrates. The cross-examining
elenchus, at first applied only to individuals, had
been turned with destructive effect on every class, every institution,
and every polity, until the whole of human life was
made to appear one mass of self-contradiction, instability,
and illusion. It had been held by some that the order of
nature offered a contrast and a correction to this bewildering
chaos. Plato, on the other hand, sought to show that the
ignorance and evil prevalent among men were only a part of
the imperfection necessarily belonging to derivative existence
of every kind. For this purpose the philosophy of Heracleitus
proved a welcome auxiliary. The pupil of Socrates had
been taught in early youth by Cratylus, an adherent of the
Ephesian school, that movement, relativity, and the conjunction
of opposites are the very conditions under which
Nature works. We may conjecture that Plato did not at
first detect any resemblance between the Heracleitean flux
and the mental bewilderment produced or brought to light
by the master of cross-examination. But his visit to Italy
would probably enable him to take a new view of the Ionian
speculations, by bringing him into contact with schools maintaining
a directly opposite doctrine. The Eleatics held that
existence remained eternally undivided, unmoved, and unchanged.
The Pythagoreans arranged all things according
to a strained and rigid antithetical construction. Then came
the identifying flash.<a id="FNanchor_132_132" href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> Unchangeable reality, divine order,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
mathematical truth—these were the objective counterpart of
the Socratic definitions, of the consistency which Socrates
introduced into conduct. The Heracleitean system applied
to phenomena only; and it faithfully reflected the incoherent
beliefs and disorderly actions of uneducated men. We are
brought into relation with the fluctuating sea of generated
and perishing natures by sense and opinion, and these reproduce,
in their irreconcilable diversity, the shifting character
of the objects with which they are conversant. Whatever we
see and feel is a mixture of being and unreality; it is, and is
not, at the same time. Sensible magnitudes are equal or
greater or less according as the standard of comparison is
chosen. Yet the very act of comparison shows that there is
something in ourselves deeper than mere sense; something
to which all individual sensations are referred as to a common
centre, and in which their images are stored up. Knowledge,
then, can no longer be identified with sensation, since the
mental reproductions of external objects are apprehended
in the absence of their originals, and since thought possesses
the further faculty of framing abstract notions not representing
any sensible objects at all.</p>

<p>We need not follow Plato’s investigations into the meaning
of knowledge and the causes of illusion any further; especially
as they do not lead, in this instance, to any positive
conclusion. The general tendency is to seek for truth within
rather than without; and to connect error partly with the disturbing
influence of sense-impressions on the higher mental
faculties, partly with the inherent confusion and instability of
the phenomena whence those impressions are derived. Our
principal concern here is to note the expansive power of
generalisation which was carrying philosophy back again
from man to Nature—the deep-seated contempt of Plato for
public opinion—and the incipient differentiation of demonstrated
from empirical truth.</p>

<p>A somewhat similar vein of reflection is worked out in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
<cite>Cratylus</cite>, a Dialogue presenting some important points of
contact with the <cite>Theaetêtus</cite>, and probably belonging to the
same period. There is the same constant reference to
Heracleitus, whose philosophy is here also treated as in great
measure, but not entirely, true; and the opposing system of
Parmenides is again mentioned, though much more briefly,
as a valuable set-off against its extravagances. The
<cite>Cratylus</cite> deals exclusively with language, just as the <cite>Theaetêtus</cite>
had dealt with sensation and mental imagery, but in
such a playful and ironical tone that its speculative importance
is likely to be overlooked. Some of the Greek philosophers
seem to have thought that the study of things might
advantageously be replaced by the study of words, which were
supposed to have a natural and necessary connexion with
their accepted meanings. This view was particularly favoured
by the Heracleiteans, who found, or fancied that they found,
a confirmation of their master’s teaching in etymology. Plato
professes to adopt the theory in question, and supports it with
a number of derivations which to us seem ludicrously absurd,
but which may possibly have been transcribed from the pages
of contemporary philologists. At last, however, he turns
round and shows that other verbal arguments, equally good,
might be adduced on behalf of Parmenides. But the most
valuable part of the discussion is a protest against the whole
theory that things can be studied through their names. Plato
justly observes that an image, to be perfect, should not reproduce
its original, but only certain aspects of it; that the
framers of language were not infallible; and that we are just
as competent to discover the nature of things as they could
be. One can imagine the delight with which he would have
welcomed the modern discovery that sensations, too, are a
language; and that the associated groups into which they
most readily gather are determined less by the necessary connexions
of things in themselves than by the exigencies of
self-preservation and reproduction in sentient beings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span></p>

<p>Through all his criticisms on the popular sources of information—sense,
language and public opinion—Plato refers to
an ideal of perfect knowledge which he assumes without
being able to define it. It must satisfy the negative condition
of being free from self-contradiction, but further than
this we cannot go. Yet, in the hands of a metaphysician, no
more than this was required to reconstruct the world. The
demand for consistency explains the practical philosophy of
Socrates. It also explains, under another form, the philosophy,
both practical and speculative, of his disciple.
Identity and the correlative of identity, difference, gradually
came to cover with their manifold combinations all knowledge,
all life, and all existence.</p>

<p>It was from mathematical science that the light of
certainty first broke. Socrates had not encouraged the study
of mathematics, either pure or applied; nor, if we may judge
from some disparaging allusions to Hippias and his lectures
in the <cite>Protagoras</cite>, did Plato at first regard it with any
particular favour. He may have acquired some notions of
arithmetic and geometry at school; but the intimate acquaintance
with, and deep interest in them, manifested throughout
his later works, probably dates from his visits to Italy, Sicily,
Cyrênê, and Egypt. In each of these places the exact
sciences were cultivated with more assiduity than at Athens;
in southern Italy they had been brought into close connexion
with philosophy by a system of mystical interpretation. The
glory of discovering their true speculative significance was
reserved for Plato. Just as he had detected a profound
analogy between the Socratic scepticism and the Heracleitean
flux, so also, by another vivid intuition, he saw in the
definitions and demonstrations of geometry a type of true
reasoning, a particular application of the Socratic logic.
Thus the two studies were brought into fruitful reaction, the
one gaining a wider applicability, and the other an exacter
method of proof. The mathematical spirit ultimately proved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
too strong for Plato, and petrified his philosophy into a lifeless
formalism; but no extraneous influence helped so much
to bring about the complete maturity of his constructive
powers, in no direction has he more profoundly influenced the
thought of later ages.</p>

<p>Both the <cite>Theaetêtus</cite> and the <cite>Cratylus</cite> contain allusions to
mathematical reasoning, but its full significance is first
exhibited in the <cite>Meno</cite>. Here the old question, whether
virtue can be taught, is again raised, to be discussed from an
entirely new point of view, and resolved into the more general
question, Can anything be taught? The answer is, Yes and No.
You may stimulate the native activity of the intellect, but you
cannot create it. Take a totally uneducated man, and, under
proper guidance, he shall discover the truths of geometry for
himself, by virtue of their self-evident clearness. Being
independent of any traceable experience, the elementary
principles of this science, of all science, must have been acquired
in some antenatal period, or rather they were never
acquired at all, they belong to the very nature of the soul
herself. The doctrine here unfolded had a great future
before it; and it has never, perhaps, been discussed with so
much eagerness as during the last half-century among ourselves.
The masters of English thought have placed the issue
first raised by Plato in the very front of philosophical
controversy; and the general public have been brought to feel
that their dearest interests hang on its decision. The subject
has, however, lost much of its adventitious interest to those
who know that the <i lang="la">à priori</i> position was turned, a hundred
years ago, by Kant. The philosopher of Königsberg showed
that, granting knowledge to be composed of two elements,
mind adds nothing to outward experience but its own
forms, the system of connexions according to which it
groups phenomena. Deprive these forms of the content
given to them by feeling, and the soul will be left beating her
wings in a vacuum. The doctrine that knowledge is not a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
dead deposit in consciousness or memory, but a living energy
whereby phenomena are, to use Kant’s words, gathered up
into the synthetic unity of apperception, has since found a
physiological basis in the theory of central innervation. And
the experiential school of psychology have simultaneously
come to recognise the existence of fixed conditions under
which consciousness works and grows, and which, in the last
analysis, resolve themselves into the apprehension of resemblance,
difference, coexistence, and succession. The most
complex cognition involves no more than these four
categories; and it is probable that they all co-operate in the
most elementary perception.</p>

<p>The truths here touched on seem to have been dimly
present to the mind of Plato. He never doubts that all
knowledge must, in some way or other, be derived from
experience; and, accordingly, he assumes that what cannot
have been learned in this world was learned in another. But
he does not (in the <cite>Meno</cite> at least) suppose that the process
ever had a beginning. It would seem that he is trying to
express in figurative language the distinction, lost almost as
soon as found, between intelligence and the facts on which
intelligence is exercised, An examination of the steps by
which Meno’s slave is brought to perceive, without being
directly told, the truth of the Pythagorean theorem, will show
that his share in the demonstration is limited to the intuition
of certain numerical equalities and inequalities. Now, to Plato,
the perception of sameness and difference meant everything.
He would have denied that the sensible world presented examples
of these relations in their ideal absoluteness and purity.
In tracing back their apprehension to the self-reflection of the
soul, the consciousness of personal identity, he would not
have transgressed the limits of a legitimate enquiry. But self-consciousness
involved a possible abstraction from disturbing
influences, which he interpreted as a real separation between
mind and matter; and, to make it more complete, an inde<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>pendent
pre-existence of the former. Nor was this all. Since
knowledge is of likeness in difference, then the central truth
of things, the reality underlying all appearance, must be an
abiding identity recognised by the soul through her previous
communion with it in a purer world. The inevitable tendency
of two identities, one subjective and the other objective, was
to coalesce in an absolute unity where all distinctions of time
and space would have disappeared, carrying the whole
mythical machinery along with them; and Plato’s logic is
always hovering on the verge of such a consummation without
being able fully to accept it. Still, the mystical tendency,
which it was reserved for Plotinus to carry out in its entirety,
is always present, though restrained by other motives,
working for the ascertainment of uniformity in theory and for
the enforcement of uniformity in practice.</p>

<p>We have accompanied Plato to a point where he begins
to see his way towards a radical reconstruction of all existing
beliefs and institutions. In the next chapter we shall attempt
to show how far he succeeded in this great purpose, how
much, in his positive contributions to thought is of permanent,
and how much of merely biographical or literary value.</p>

<small>PLATO AS A REFORMER.</small></h2>


<h3><a id="V-I"></a>I.</h3>

<p>In the last chapter we considered the philosophy of Plato
chiefly under its critical and negative aspects. We saw how
it was exclusively from that side that he at first apprehended
and enlarged the dialectic of Socrates, how deeply his scepticism
was coloured by the religious reaction of the age, and
how he attempted, out of his master’s mouth, to overturn the
positive teaching of the master himself. We saw how, in the
<cite>Protagoras</cite>, he sketched a theory of ethics, which was no
sooner completed than it became the starting-point of a still
more extended and arduous enquiry. We followed the
widening horizon of his speculations until they embraced the
whole contemporary life of Hellas, and involved it in a
common condemnation as either hopelessly corrupt, or containing
within itself the seeds of corruption. We then saw
how, by a farther generalisation, he was led to look for the
sources of error in the laws of man’s sensuous nature and of
the phenomenal world with which it holds communion; how,
moreover, under the guidance of suggestions coming both
from within and from without, he reverted to the earlier
schools of Greek thought, and brought their results into
parallelism with the main lines of Socratic dialectic. And
finally, we watched him planting a firm foothold on the basis
of mathematical demonstration; seeking in the very constitution
of the soul itself for a derivation of the truths which
sensuous experience could not impart, and winning back from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
a more profoundly reasoned religion the hope, the self-confidence,
the assurance of perfect knowledge, which had been
formerly surrendered in deference to the demands of a merely
external and traditional faith. That God alone is wise, and
by consequence alone good, might still remain a fixed principle
with Plato; but it ceased to operate as a restraint on
human aspiration when he had come to recognise an essential
unity among all forms of conscious life, which, though it
might be clouded and forgotten, could never be entirely effaced.
And when Plato tells us, at the close of his career, that God,
far more than any individual man, is the measure of all things,<a id="FNanchor_133_133" href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">133</a>
who can doubt that he had already learned to identify the
human and divine essences in the common notion of a universal
soul?</p>

<p>The germ of this new dogmatism was present in Plato’s
mind from the very beginning, and was partly an inheritance
from older forms of thought. The <cite>Apologia</cite> had reproduced
one important feature in the positive teaching of Socrates—the
distinction between soul and body, and the necessity of
attending to the former rather than to the latter: and this
had now acquired such significance as to leave no standing-room
for the agnosticism with which it had been incompatible
from the first. The same irresistible force of expansion which
had brought the human soul into communion with absolute
truth, was to be equally verified in a different direction.
Plato was too much interested in practical questions to be
diverted from them long by any theoretical philosophy; or,
perhaps, we should rather say that this interest had accompanied
and inspired him throughout. It is from the essential
relativity of mind, the profound craving for intellectual sympathy
with other minds, that all mystical imaginations and
super-subtle abstractions take rise; so that, when the strain of
transcendent absorption and ecstasy is relaxed under the chilling
but beneficent contact of earthly experience, they become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
condensed into ideas for the reconstitution of life and society
on a basis of reciprocity, of self-restraint, and of self-devotion
to a commonwealth greater and more enduring than any
individual, while, at the same time, presenting to each in
objective form the principle by virtue of which only, instead
of being divided, he can become reconciled with himself.
Here we have the creed of all philosophy, whether theological,
metaphysical, or positive, that there is, or that there should
be, this threefold unity of feeling, of action, and of thought, of
the soul, of society, and of universal existence, to win which is
everlasting life, while to be without it is everlasting death.
This creed must be re-stated and re-interpreted at every revolution
of thought. We have to see how it was, for the first
time, stated and interpreted by Plato.</p>

<p>The principal object of Plato’s negative criticism had been
to emphasise the distinction between reality and appearance
in the world without, between sense, or imagination, and
reason in the human soul. True to the mediatorial spirit of
Greek thought, his object now was to bridge over the seemingly
impassable gulf. We must not be understood to say
that these two distinct, and to some extent contrasted, tendencies
correspond to two definitely divided periods of his
life. It is evident that the tasks of dissection and reconstruction
were often carried on conjointly, and represented two
aspects of an indivisible process. But on the whole there is
good reason to believe that Plato, like other men, was more
inclined to pull to pieces in his youth and to build up in his
later days. We are, therefore, disposed to agree with those
critics who assign both the <cite>Phaedrus</cite> and the <cite>Symposium</cite> to a
comparatively advanced stage of Platonic speculation. It is
less easy to decide which of the two was composed first, for
there seems to be a greater maturity of thought in the one
and of style in the other. For our purposes it will be most
convenient to consider them together.</p>

<p>We have seen how Plato came to look on mathematics as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
an introduction to absolute knowledge. He now discovered a
parallel method of approach towards perfect wisdom in an
order of experience which to most persons might seem as far
as possible removed from exact science—in those passionate
feelings which were excited in the Greek imagination by the
spectacle of youthful beauty, without distinction of sex.
There was, at least among the Athenians, a strong intellectual
element in the attachments arising out of such feelings;
and the strange anomaly might often be seen of a man devoting
himself to the education of a youth whom he was, in
other respects, doing his utmost to corrupt. Again, the beauty
by which a Greek felt most fascinated came nearer to a visible
embodiment of mind than any that has ever been known, and
as such could be associated with the purest philosophical
aspirations. And, finally, the passion of love in its normal
manifestations is an essentially generic instinct, being that
which carries an individual most entirely out of himself, making
him instrumental to the preservation of the race in forms
of ever-increasing comeliness and vigour; so that, given a
wise training and a wide experience, the maintenance of a
noble breed may safely be entrusted to its infallible selection.<a id="FNanchor_134_134" href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">134</a>
All these points of view have been developed by Plato with
such copiousness of illustration and splendour of language that
his name is still associated in popular fancy with an ideal of
exalted and purified desire.</p>

<p>So far, however, we only stand on the threshold of Platonic
love. The earthly passion, being itself a kind of generalisation,
is our first step in the ascent to that highest stage of
existence where wisdom and virtue and happiness are one—the
good to which all other goods are related as means to an end.
But love is not only an introduction to philosophy, it is a type
of philosophy itself. Both are conditions intermediate between
vacuity and fulfilment; desire being by its very nature dis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>satisfied,
and vanishing at the instant that its object is
attained. The philosopher is a lover of wisdom, and therefore
not wise; and yet not wholly ignorant, for he knows that
he knows nothing. Thus we seem to be thrown back on the
standpoint of Plato’s earliest agnosticism. Nevertheless, if
the <cite>Symposium</cite> agrees nominally with the <cite>Apologia</cite>, in
reality it marks a much more advanced point of speculation.
The idea of what knowledge is has begun to assume a much
clearer expression. We gather from various hints and suggestions
that it is the perception of likeness; the very process
of ascending generalisation typified by intellectual love.</p>

<p>It is worthy of remark that in the Platonic Erôs we have
the germ—or something more than the germ—of Aristotle’s
whole metaphysical system.<a id="FNanchor_135_135" href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> According to the usual law of
speculative evolution, what was subjective in the one becomes
objective in the other. With Plato the passion for knowledge
had been merely the guiding principle of a few chosen spirits.
With Aristotle it is the living soul of Nature, the secret spring
of movement, from the revolution of the outermost starry
sphere to the decomposition and recomposition of our mutable
terrestrial elements; and from these again through the
whole scale of organic life, up to the moral culture of man
and the search for an ideally-constituted state. What enables
all these myriad movements to continue through eternity,
returning ever in an unbroken circle on themselves, is the
yearning of unformed matter—that is to say, of unrealised
power—towards the absolute unchanging actuality, the self-thinking
thought, unmoved, but moving every other form of
existence by the desire to participate in its ineffable perfection.
Born of the Hellenic enthusiasm for beauty, this wonderful
conception subsequently became incorporated with the official
teaching of Catholic theology. What had once been a theme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
for ribald merriment or for rhetorical ostentation among the
golden youth of Athens, furnished the motive for his most
transcendent meditations to the Angel of the Schools; but the
fire which lurked under the dusty abstractions of Aquinas
needed the touch of a poet and a lover before it could be
rekindled into flame. The eyes of Beatrice completed what
the dialectic of Plato had begun; and the hundred cantos of
her adorer found their fitting close in the love that moves the
sun and the other stars.</p>

<p>We must, however, observe that, underlying all these
poetical imaginations, there is a deeper and wider law of
human nature to which they unconsciously bear witness—the
intimate connexion of religious mysticism with the passion of
love. By this we do not mean the constant interference of
the one with the other, whether for the purpose of stimulation,
as with the naturalistic religions, or for the purpose of restraint,
as with the ethical religions; but we mean that they seem to
divide between them a common fund of nervous energy, so
that sometimes their manifestations are inextricably confounded,
as in certain debased forms of modern Christianity;
sometimes they utterly exclude one another; and sometimes,
which is the most frequent case of any, the one is transformed
into the other, their substantial identity and continuity being
indicated very frankly by their use of the same language, the
same ritual, and the same aesthetic decoration. And this
will show how the decay of religious belief may be accompanied
by an outbreak of moral licence, without our being
obliged to draw the inference that passion can only be held
in check by irrational beliefs, or by organisations whose supremacy
is fatal to industrial, political, and intellectual progress.
For, if our view of the case be correct, the passion was not
really restrained, but only turned in a different direction, and
frequently nourished into hysterical excess; so that, with the
inevitable decay of theology, it returns to its old haunts,
bringing with it seven devils worse than the first. After the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
Crusades came the Courts of Love; after the Dominican and
Franciscan movements, the Renaissance; after Puritanism,
the Restoration; after Jesuitism, the Regency. Nor is this
all. The passion of which we are speaking, when abnormally
developed and unbalanced by severe intellectual exercise, is
habitually accompanied by delirious jealousy, by cruelty, and
by deceit. On taking the form of religion, the influence of
its evil associates immediately becomes manifest in the suppression
of alien creeds, in the tortures inflicted on their
adherents, and in the maxim that no faith need be kept with
a heretic. Persecution has been excused on the ground that
any means were justifiable for the purpose of saving souls
from eternal torment. But how came it to be believed that
such a consequence was involved in a mere error of judgment?
The faith did not create the intolerance, but the intolerance
created the faith, and so gave an idealised expression to the
jealous fury accompanying a passion which no spiritual
alchemy can purify from its original affinities. It is not by
turning this most terrible instinct towards a supernatural
object that we should combat it, but by developing the active
and masculine in preference to the emotional and feminine
side of our nervous organisation.<a id="FNanchor_136_136" href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">136</a></p>

<p>In addition to its other great lessons, the <cite>Symposium</cite>
has afforded Plato an opportunity for contrasting his own
method of philosophising with pre-Socratic modes of thought.
For it consists of a series of discourses in praise of love, so
arranged as to typify the manner in which Greek speculation,
after beginning with mythology, subsequently advanced to
physical theories of phenomena, then passed from the historical
to the contemporary method, asking, not whence did things
come, but what are they in themselves; and finally arrived
at the logical standpoint of analysis, classification, and induction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span></p>

<p>The nature of dialectic is still further elucidated in the
<cite>Phaedrus</cite>, where it is also contrasted with the method, or
rather the no-method, of popular rhetoric. Here, again, discussions
about love are chosen as an illustration. A discourse
on the subject by no less a writer than Lysias is quoted and
shown to be deficient in the most elementary requisites of
logical exposition. The different arguments are strung together
without any principle of arrangement, and ambiguous
terms are used without being defined. In insisting on the
necessity of definition, Plato followed Socrates; but he defines
according to a totally different method. Socrates had arrived
at his general notions partly by a comparison of particular
instances with a view to eliciting the points where they agreed,
partly by amending the conceptions already in circulation.
We have seen that the earliest Dialogues attributed to Plato
are one long exposure of the difficulties attending such a procedure;
and his subsequent investigations all went to prove
that nothing solid could be built on such shifting foundations
as sense and opinion. Meanwhile increasing familiarity with
the great ontological systems had taught him to begin with
the most general notions, and to work down from them to the
most particular. The consequence was that dialectic came to
mean nothing but classification or logical division. Definition
was absorbed into this process, and reasoning by syllogism
was not yet differentiated from it. To tell what a thing was,
meant to fix its place in the universal order of existence, and
its individual existence was sufficiently accounted for by the
same determination. If we imagine first a series of concentric
circles, then a series of contrasts symmetrically disposed on
either side of a central dividing line, and finally a series of
transitions descending from the most absolute unity to the
most irregular diversity—we shall, by combining the three
schemes, arrive at some understanding of the Platonic dialectic.
To assign anything its place in these various sequences
was at once to define it and to demonstrate the necessity of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
its existence. The arrangement is also equivalent to a theory
of final causes; for everything has a function to perform,
marked out by its position, and bringing it into relation with
the universal order. Such a system would inevitably lead to
the denial of evil, were not evil itself interpreted as the necessary
correlative of good, or as a necessary link in the descending
manifestations of reality. Moreover, by virtue of his
identifying principle, Plato saw in the lowest forms a shadow
or reflection of the highest. Hence the many surprises, concessions,
and returns to abandoned positions which we find in
his later writings. The three moments of Greek thought,
circumscription, antithesis, and mediation, work in such close
union, or with such bewildering rapidity of alternation, through
all his dialectic, that we are never sure whither he is leading
us, and not always sure that he knows it himself.</p>

<p>In the opening chapter of this work we endeavoured to
explain how the Pythagorean philosophy arose out of the intoxicated
delight inspired by a first acquaintance with the
manifold properties of number and figure. If we would enter
into the spirit of Platonism, we must similarly throw ourselves
back into the time when the idea of a universal classification
first dawned on men’s minds. We must remember how it
gratified the Greek love of order combined with individuality;
what unbounded opportunities for asking and answering
questions it supplied; and what promises of practical regeneration
it held out. Not without a shade of sadness for so many
baffled efforts and so many blighted hopes, yet also with a
grateful recollection of all that reason has accomplished, and
with something of his own high intellectual enthusiasm, shall
we listen to Plato’s prophetic words—words of deeper import
than their own author knew—‘If I find any man who is able
to see a One and Many in Nature, him I follow and walk in
his steps as if he were a god.’<a id="FNanchor_137_137" href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">137</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span></p>

<p>It is interesting to see how the most comprehensive
systems of the present century, even when most opposed to
the metaphysical spirit, are still constructed on the plan long
ago sketched by Plato. Alike in his classification of the
sciences, in his historical deductions, and in his plans for the
reorganisation of society, Auguste Comte adopts a scheme of
ascending or descending generality. The conception of differentiation
and integration employed both by Hegel and by
Mr. Herbert Spencer is also of Platonic origin; only, what
with the ancient thinker was a statical law of order has
become with his modern successors a dynamic law of progress;
while, again, there is this distinction between the German
and the English philosopher, that the former construes as successive
moments of the Idea what the latter regards as simultaneous
and interdependent processes of evolution.</p>


<h3><a id="V-II"></a>II.</h3>

<p>The study of psychology with Plato stands in a fourfold
relation to his general theory of the world. The dialectic
method, without which Nature would remain unintelligible, is
a function of the soul, and constitutes its most essential
activity; then soul, as distinguished from body, represents
the higher, supersensual element of existence; thirdly, the
objective dualism of reality and appearance is reproduced in
the subjective dualism of reason and sense; and lastly, soul,
as the original spring of movement, mediates between the
eternal entities which are unmoved and the material phenomena
which are subject to a continual flux. It is very
characteristic of Plato that he first strains an antithesis to the
utmost and then endeavours to reconcile its extremes by the
interposition of one or more intermediate links. So, while
assigning this office to soul as a part of the universe, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
classifies the psychic functions themselves according to a
similar principle. On the intellectual side he places true
opinion, or what we should now call empirical knowledge,
midway between demonstration and sense-perception. Such
at least seems to be the result reached in the <cite>Theaetêtus</cite> and
the <cite>Meno</cite>. In the <cite>Republic</cite> a further analysis leads to a
somewhat different arrangement. Opinion is placed between
knowledge and ignorance; while the possible objects to which
it corresponds form a transition from being to not-being.
Subsequently mathematical reasoning is distinguished from
the higher science which takes cognisance of first principles,
and thus serves to connect it with simple opinion; while this
again, dealing as it does with material objects, is related to
the knowledge of their shadows as the most perfect science is
related to mathematics.<a id="FNanchor_138_138" href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">138</a></p>

<p>Turning from dialectic to ethics, Plato in like manner feels
the need of interposing a mediator between reason and
appetite. The quality chosen for this purpose he calls θυμός,
a term which does not, as has been erroneously supposed,
correspond to our word Will, but rather to pride, or the
feeling of personal honour. It is both the seat of military
courage and the natural auxiliary of reason, with which it
co-operates in restraining the animal desires. It is a characteristic
difference between Socrates and Plato that the former
should have habitually reinforced his arguments for virtue by
appeals to self-interest; while the latter, with his aristocratic
way of looking at things, prefers to enlist the aid of a
haughtier feeling on their behalf. Aristotle followed in the
same track when he taught that to be overcome by anger is
less discreditable than to be overcome by desire. In reality
none of the instincts tending to self-preservation is more
praiseworthy than another, or more amenable to the control
of reason. Plato’s tripartite division of mind cannot be made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
to fit into the classifications of modern psychology, which are
adapted not only to a more advanced state of knowledge but
also to more complex conditions of life. But the characters
of women, by their greater simplicity and uniformity, show to
some extent what those of men may once have been; and it
will, perhaps, confirm the analysis of the <cite>Phaedrus</cite> to recall
the fact that personal pride is still associated with moral
principle in the guardianship of female virtue.</p>

<p>If the soul served to connect the eternal realities with the
fleeting appearances by which they were at once darkened,
relieved, and shadowed forth, it was also a bond of union
between the speculative and the practical philosophy of Plato;
and in discussing his psychology we have already passed
from the one to the other. The transition will become still
easier if we remember that the question, ‘What is knowledge?’
was, according to our view, originally suggested by a
theory reducing ethical science to a hedonistic calculus, and
that along with it would arise another question, ‘What is
pleasure?’ This latter enquiry, though incidentally touched
on elsewhere, is not fully dealt with in any Dialogue except
the <cite>Philêbus</cite>, which we agree with Prof. Jowett in referring to
a very late period of Platonic authorship. But the line of
argument which it pursues had probably been long familiar
to our philosopher. At any rate, the <cite>Phaedo</cite>, the <cite>Republic</cite>,
and perhaps the <cite>Gorgias</cite>, assume, as already proved, that
pleasure is not the highest good. The question is one on
which thinkers are still divided. It seems, indeed, to lie
outside the range of reason, and the disputants are accordingly
obliged to invoke the authority either of individual
consciousness or of common consent on behalf of their
respective opinions. We have, however, got so far beyond
the ancients that the doctrine of egoistic hedonism has been
abandoned by almost everybody. The substitution of
another’s pleasure for our own as the object of pursuit was
not a conception which presented itself to any Greek moralist,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
although the principle of self-sacrifice was maintained by
some of them, and especially by Plato, to its fullest extent.
Pleasure-seeking being inseparably associated with selfishness,
the latter was best attacked through the former, and if Plato’s
logic does not commend itself to our understanding, we must
admit that it was employed in defence of a noble cause.</p>

<p>The style of polemics adopted on this occasion, whatever
else may be its value, will serve excellently to illustrate the
general dialectic method of attack. When Plato particularly
disliked a class of persons, or an institution, or an art, or a
theory, or a state of consciousness, he tried to prove that it
was confused, unstable, and self-contradictory; besides taking
full advantage of any discredit popularly attached to it. All
these objections are brought to bear with full force against
pleasure. Some pleasures are delusive, since the reality of
them falls far short of the anticipation; all pleasure is essentially
transitory, a perpetual becoming, never a fixed state,
and therefore not an end of action; pleasures which ensue on
the satisfaction of desires are necessarily accompanied by
pains and disappear simultaneously with them; the most
intense, and for that reason the most typical, pleasures, are
associated with feelings of shame, and their enjoyment is carefully
hidden out of sight.</p>

<p>Such arguments have almost the air of an afterthought,
and Plato was perhaps more powerfully swayed by other considerations,
which we shall now proceed to analyse. When
pleasure was assumed to be the highest good, knowledge
was agreed to be the indispensable means for its attainment;
and, as so often happens, the means gradually substituted
itself for the end. Nor was this all; for knowledge (or
reason) being not only the means but the supreme arbiter,
when called on to adjudicate between conflicting claims,
would naturally pronounce in its own favour. Naturally, also,
a moralist who made science the chief interest of his own life
would come to believe that it was the proper object of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
life, whether attended or not by any pleasurable emotion.
And so, in direct opposition to the utilitarian theory, Plato
declares at last that to brave a lesser pain in order to escape
from a greater, or to renounce a lesser pleasure in order to
secure a greater, is cowardice and intemperance in disguise;
and that wisdom, which he had formerly regarded as a means
to other ends, is the one end for which everything else should
be exchanged.<a id="FNanchor_139_139" href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> Perhaps it may have strengthened him in
this attitude to observe that the many, whose opinion he so
thoroughly despised, made pleasure their aim in life, while
the fastidious few preferred knowledge. Yet, after a time,
even the latter alternative failed to satisfy his restless spirit.
For the conception of knowledge resolved itself into the
deeper conceptions of a knowing subject and a known object,
the soul and the universe, each of which became in turn the
supreme ideal. What interpretation should be given to
virtue depended on the choice between them. According to
the one view it was a purification of the higher principle within
us from material wants and passions. Sensual gratifications
should be avoided, because they tend to degrade and pollute
the soul. Death should be fearlessly encountered, because it
will release her from the restrictions of bodily existence. But
Plato had too strong a grasp on the realities of life to remain
satisfied with a purely ascetic morality. Knowledge, on the
objective side, brought him into relation with an organised
universe where each individual existed, not for his own sake
but for the sake of the whole, to fulfil a definite function in
the system of which he formed a part. And if from one
point of view the soul herself was an absolutely simple indivisible
substance, from another point of view she reflected the
external order, and only fulfilled the law of her being when
each separate faculty was exercised within its appropriate
sphere.</p>

<p>There still remained one last problem to solve, one point<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
where the converging streams of ethical and metaphysical
speculation met and mixed. Granted that knowledge is the
soul’s highest energy, what is the object of this beatific
vision? Granted that all particular energies co-operate for a
common purpose, what is the end to which they are subordinated?
Granted that dialectic leads us up through ascending
gradations to one all-comprehensive idea, how is that idea to
be defined? Plato only attempts to answer this last question
by re-stating it under the form of an illustration. As the sun
at once gives life to all Nature, and light to the eye by which
Nature is perceived, so also the idea of Good is the cause of
existence and of knowledge alike, but transcends them both
as an absolute unity, of which we cannot even say that it
is, for the distinction of subject and predicate would bring
back relativity and plurality again. Here we seem to have the
Socratic paradox reversed. Socrates identified virtue with
knowledge, but, at the same time, entirely emptied the latter
of its speculative content. Plato, inheriting the idea of
knowledge in its artificially restricted significance, was irresistibly
drawn back to the older philosophy whence it had
been originally borrowed; then, just as his master had given
an ethical application to science, so did he, travelling over the
same ground in an opposite direction, extend the theory of
ethics far beyond its legitimate range, until a principle which
seemed to have no meaning, except in reference to human
conduct, became the abstract bond of union between all
reality and all thought.</p>

<p>Whether Plato ever succeeded in making the idea of Good
quite clear to others, or even to himself, is more than we can
tell. In the <cite>Republic</cite> he declines giving further explanations
on the ground that his pupils have not passed through the
necessary mathematical initiation. Whether quantitative
reasoning was to furnish the form or the matter of transcendent
dialectic is left undetermined. We are told that on one
occasion a large audience assembled to hear Plato lecture on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
the Good, but that, much to their disappointment, the discourse
was entirely filled with geometrical and astronomical
investigations. Bearing in mind, however, that mathematical
science deals chiefly with equations, and that astronomy,
according to Plato, had for its object to prove the absolute
uniformity of the celestial motions, we may perhaps conclude
that the idea of Good meant no more than the abstract
notion of identity or indistinguishable likeness. The more
complex idea of law as a uniformity of relations, whether coexistent
or successive, had not then dawned, but it has since
been similarly employed to bring physics into harmony with
ethics and logic.</p>


<h3><a id="V-III"></a>III.</h3>

<p>So far we have followed the evolution of Plato’s philosophy
as it may have been effected under the impulse of
purely theoretical motives. We have now to consider what
form was imposed on it by the more imperious exigencies of
practical experience. Here, again, we find Plato taking up
and continuing the work of Socrates, but on a vastly greater
scale. There was, indeed, a kind of pre-established harmony
between the expression of thought on the one hand and the
increasing need for its application to life on the other. For
the spread of public corruption had gone on <i lang="la">pari passu</i> with
the development of philosophy. The teaching of Socrates
was addressed to individuals, and dealt chiefly with private
morality. On other points he was content to accept the law
of the land and the established political constitution as
sufficiently safe guides. He was not accustomed to see
them defied or perverted into instruments of selfish aggrandisement;
nor, apparently, had the possibility of such a
contingency occurred to him. Still less did he imagine that
all social institutions then existing were radically wrong.
Hence the personal virtues held a more important place in
his system than the social virtues. His attacks were directed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
against slothfulness and self-indulgence, against the ignorant
temerity which hurried some young men into politics before
their education was finished, and the timidity or fastidiousness
which prevented others from discharging the highest
duties of citizenship. Nor, in accepting the popular religion
of his time, had he any suspicion that its sanctions might be
invoked on behalf of successful violence and fraud. We have
already shown how differently Plato felt towards his age, and
how much deeper as well as more shameless was the demoralisation
with which he set himself to contend. It must
also be remembered how judicial proceedings had come to
overshadow every other public interest; and how the highest
culture of the time had, at least in his eyes, become identified
with the systematic perversion of truth and right. These
considerations will explain why Greek philosophy, while
moving on a higher plane, passed through the same orbit
which had been previously described by Greek poetry. Precisely
as the lessons of moderation in Homer had been
followed by the lessons of justice in Aeschylus, precisely as
the religion which was a selfish traffic between gods and men,
and had little to tell of a life beyond the grave, was replaced
by the nobler faith in a divine guardianship of morality and
a retributive judgment after death—so also did the Socratic
ethics and the Socratic theology lead to a system which
made justice the essence of morality and religion its everlasting
consecration.</p>

<p>Temperance and justice are very clearly distinguished in
our minds. The one is mainly a self-regarding, the other
mainly a social virtue. But it would be a mistake to suppose
that the distinction was equally clear to Plato. He had
learned from Socrates that all virtue is one. He found himself
confronted by men who pointedly opposed interest to
honour and expediency to fair-dealing, without making any
secret of their preference for the former. Here, as elsewhere,
he laboured to dissolve away the vulgar antithesis and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
substitute for it a deeper one—the antithesis between real
and apparent goods. He was quite ready to imagine the
case of a man who might have to incur all sorts of suffering
in the practice of justice even to the extent of infamy, torture,
and death; but without denying that these were evils, he held
that to practise injustice with the accompaniment of worldly
prosperity was a greater evil still. And this conviction is
quite unconnected with his belief in a future life. He would
not have agreed with St. Paul that virtue is a bad calculation
without the hope of a reward for it hereafter. His morality
is absolutely independent of any extrinsic considerations.
Nevertheless, he holds that in our own interest we should do
what is right; and it never seems to have entered his
thoughts that there could be any other motive for doing it.
We have to explain how such a paradox was possible.</p>

<p>Plato seems to have felt very strongly that all virtuous
action tends towards a good exceeding in value any temporary
sacrifice which it may involve; and the accepted
connotation of ethical terms went entirely along with this
belief. But he could not see that a particular action might
be good for the community at large and bad for the individual
who performed it, not in a different sense but in the very
same sense, as involving a diminution of his happiness. For
from Plato’s abstract and generalising point of view all good
was homogeneous, and the welfare of the individual was
absolutely identified with the welfare of the whole to which
he belonged. As against those who made right dependent
on might and erected self-indulgence into the law of life
Plato occupied an impregnable position. He showed that
such principles made society impossible, and that without
honour even a gang of thieves cannot hold together.<a id="FNanchor_140_140" href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> He
also saw that it is reason which brings each individual into
relation with the whole and enables him to understand his
obligations towards it; but at the same time he gave this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
reason a personal character which does not properly belong
to it; or, what comes to the same thing, he treated human
beings as pure <i lang="la">entia rationis</i>, thus unwittingly removing the
necessity for having any morality at all. On his assumption
it would be absurd to break the law; but neither would there
be any temptation to break it, nor would any unpleasant
consequences follow on its violation. Plato speaks of injustice
as an injury to the soul’s health, and therefore as the greatest
evil that can befall a human being, without observing that
the inference involves a confusion of terms. For his argument
requires that soul should mean both the whole of
conscious life and the system of abstract notions through
which we communicate and co-operate with our fellow-creatures.
All crime is a serious disturbance to the latter, for
it cannot without absurdity be made the foundation of a
general rule; but, apart from penal consequences, it does not
impair, and may benefit the former.</p>

<p>While Plato identified the individual with the community
by slurring over the possible divergence of their interests, he
still further contributed to their logical confusion by resolving
the ego into a multitude of conflicting faculties and impulses
supposed to represent the different classes of which a State is
made up. His opponents held that justice and law emanate
from the ruling power in the body politic; and they were
brought to admit that supreme power is properly vested in the
wisest and best citizens. Transferring these principles to the
inner forum, he maintained that a psychological aristocracy
could only be established by giving reason a similar control
over the animal passions.<a id="FNanchor_141_141" href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> At first sight, this seemed to
imply no more than a return to the standpoint of Socrates, or
of Plato himself in the <cite>Protagoras</cite>. The man who indulges
his desires within the limits prescribed by a regard for their
safe satisfaction through his whole life, may be called temperate
and reasonable, but he is not necessarily just. If, how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>ever,
we identify the paramount authority within with the
paramount authority without, we shall have to admit that
there is a faculty of justice in the individual soul corresponding
to the objective justice of political law; and since the
supreme virtue is agreed on all hands to be reason, we must
go a step further and admit that justice is reason, or that it
is reasonable to be just; and that by consequence the height
of injustice is the height of folly. Moreover, this fallacious
substitution of justice for temperance was facilitated by the
circumstance that although the former virtue is not involved
in the latter, the latter is to a very great extent involved in the
former. Self-control by no means carries with it a respect for
the rights of others; but where such respect exists it necessitates
a considerable amount of self-control.</p>

<p>We trust that the steps of a difficult argument have been
made clear by the foregoing analysis; and that the whole
process has been shown to hinge on the ambiguous use of such
notions as the individual and the community, of which the one
is paradoxically construed as a plurality and the other as a
unity; justice, which is alternately taken in the sense of control
exercised by the worthiest, control of passion in the
general interest, control of our passions in the interest of others,
and control of the same passions in our own interest; and wisdom
or reason, which sometimes means any kind of excellence,
sometimes the excellence of a harmonious society, and sometimes
the excellence of a well-balanced mind. Thus, out of
self-regarding virtue social virtue is elicited, the whole process
being ultimately conditioned by that identifying power which
was at once the strength and the weakness of Plato’s genius.</p>

<p>Plato knew perfectly well that although rhetoricians and
men of the world might be silenced, they could not be converted
nor even convinced by such arguments as these. So
far from thinking it possible to reason men into virtue, he has
observed of those who are slaves to their senses that you must
improve them before you can teach them the truth.<span class="ref"><a href="#L">L</a></span> And he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
felt that if the complete assimilation of the individual and the
community was to become more than a mere logical formula,
it must be effected by a radical reform in the training of the
one and in the institutions of the other. Accordingly, he set
himself to elaborate a scheme for the purpose, our knowledge
of which is chiefly derived from his greatest work, the <cite>Republic</cite>.
We have already made large use of the negative criticism
scattered through that Dialogue; we have now to examine the
positive teaching by which it was supplemented.</p>


<h3><a id="V-IV"></a>IV.</h3>

<p>Plato, like Socrates, makes religious instruction the basis
of education. But where the master had been content to set
old beliefs on a new basis of demonstration, the disciple aimed
at nothing less than their complete purification from irrational
and immoral ingredients. He lays down two great principles,
that God is good, and that He is true.<a id="FNanchor_142_142" href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> Every story which is
inconsistent with such a character must be rejected; so also
must everything in the poets which redounds to the discredit
of the national heroes, together with everything tending in the
remotest degree to make vice attractive or virtue repellent.
It is evident that Plato, like Xenophanes, repudiated not only
the scandalous details of popular mythology, but also the
anthropomorphic conceptions which lay at its foundation;
although he did not think it advisable to state his unbelief
with equal frankness. His own theology was a sort of star-worship,
and he proved the divinity of the heavenly bodies by
an appeal to the uniformity of their movements.<a id="FNanchor_143_143" href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> He further
taught that the world was created by an absolutely good
Being; but we cannot be sure that this was more than a
popular version of the theory which placed the abstract idea
of Good at the summit of the dialectic series. The truth is
that there are two distinct types of religion, the one chiefly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
interested in the existence and attributes of God, the other
chiefly interested in the destiny of the human soul. The former
is best represented by Judaism, the latter by Buddhism. Plato
belongs to the psychic rather than to the theistic type. The
doctrine of immortality appears again and again in his Dialogues,
and one of the most beautiful among them is entirely
devoted to proving it. He seems throughout to be conscious
that he is arguing in favour of a paradox. Here, at least,
there are no appeals to popular prejudice such as figure so
largely in similar discussions among ourselves. The belief in
immortality had long been stirring; but it had not taken deep
root among the Ionian Greeks. We cannot even be sure that
it was embraced as a consoling hope by any but the highest
minds anywhere in Hellas, or by them for more than a brief
period. It would be easy to maintain that this arose from
some natural incongeniality to the Greek imagination in
thoughts which drew it away from the world of sense and the
delights of earthly life. But the explanation breaks down immediately
when we attempt to verify it by a wider experience.
No modern nation enjoys life so keenly as the French. Yet,
quite apart from traditional dogmas, there is no nation that
counts so many earnest supporters of the belief in a spiritual
existence beyond the grave. And, to take an individual
example, it is just the keen relish which Mr. Browning’s Cleon
has for every sort of enjoyment which makes him shrink back
with horror from the thought of annihilation, and grasp at any
promise of a happiness to be prolonged through eternity. A
closer examination is needed to show us by what causes the
current of Greek thought was swayed.</p>

<p>The great religious movement of the sixth and fifth
centuries—chiefly represented for us by the names of Pythagoras,
Aeschylus, and Pindar—would in all probability have
entirely won over the educated classes, and given definiteness
to the half-articulate utterances of popular tradition, had it
not been arrested prematurely by the development of physical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
speculation. We showed in the first chapter that Greek
philosophy in its earliest stages was entirely materialistic. It
differed, indeed, from modern materialism in holding that the
soul, or seat of conscious life, is an entity distinct from the
body; but the distinction was one between a grosser and a
finer matter, or else between a simpler and a more complex
arrangement of the same matter, not between an extended
and an indivisible substance. Whatever theories, then, were
entertained with respect to the one would inevitably come to
be entertained also with respect to the other. Now, with the
exception of the Eleates, who denied the reality of change
and separation altogether, every school agreed in teaching
that all particular bodies are formed either by differentiation
or by decomposition and recomposition out of the same
primordial elements. From this it followed, as a natural
consequence, that, although the whole mass of matter was
eternal, each particular aggregate of matter must perish in
order to release the elements required for the formation of
new aggregates. It is obvious that, assuming the soul to be
material, its immortality was irreconcilable with such a
doctrine as this. A combination of four elements and two
conflicting forces, such as Empedocles supposed the human
mind to be, could not possibly outlast the organism in which
it was enclosed; and if Empedocles himself, by an inconsistency
not uncommon with men of genius, refused to draw
the only legitimate conclusion from his own principles, the
discrepancy could not fail to force itself on his successors.
Still more fatal to the belief in a continuance of personal
identity after death was the theory put forward by Diogenes
of Apollonia, that there is really no personal identity even in
life—that consciousness is only maintained by a perpetual inhalation
of the vital air in which all reason resides. The soul
very literally left the body with the last breath, and had a poor
chance of holding together afterwards, especially, as the wits
observed, if a high wind happened to be blowing at the time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span></p>

<p>It would appear that even in the Pythagorean school
there had been a reaction against a doctrine which its founder
had been the first to popularise in Hellas. The Pythagoreans
had always attributed great importance to the conceptions of
harmony and numerical proportion; and they soon came to
think of the soul as a ratio which the different elements of the
animal body bore to one another; or as a musical concord
resulting from the joint action of its various members, which
might be compared to the strings of a lute. But</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse indent10">‘When the lute is broken</div>
  <div class="verse">Sweet tones are remembered not.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And so, with the dissolution of our bodily organism, the
music of consciousness would pass away for ever. Perhaps
no form of psychology taught in the Greek schools has
approached nearer to modern thought than this. It was
professed at Thebes by two Pythagoreans, Cebes and
Simmias, in the time of Plato. He rightly regarded them as
formidable opponents, for they were ready to grant whatever
he claimed for the soul in the way of immateriality and
superiority to the body, while denying the possibility of its
separate existence. We may so far anticipate the course of
our exposition as to mention that the direct argument by
which he met them was a reference to the moving power of
mind, and to the constraint exercised by reason over passionate
impulse; characteristics which the analogy with a
musical harmony failed to explain. But his chief reliance
was on an order of considerations, the historical genesis of
which we shall now proceed to trace.</p>

<p>It was by that somewhat slow and circuitous process, the
negation of a negation, that spiritualism was finally established.
The shadows of doubt gathered still more thickly
around futurity before another attempt could be made to
remove them. For the scepticism of the Humanists and the
ethical dialectic of Socrates, if they tended to weaken the
dogmatic materialism of physical philosophy, were at first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
not more favourable to the new faith which that philosophy
had suddenly eclipsed. For the one rejected every kind of
supernaturalism; and the other did not attempt to go behind
what had been directly revealed by the gods, or was discoverable
from an examination of their handiwork. Nevertheless,
the new enquiries, with their exclusively subjective
direction, paved the way for a return to the religious development
previously in progress. By leading men to think of
mind as, above all, a principle of knowledge and deliberate
action, they altogether freed it from those material associations
which brought it under the laws of external Nature,
where every finite existence was destined, sooner or later, to
be reabsorbed and to disappear. The position was completely
reversed when Nature was, as it were, brought up
before the bar of Mind to have her constitution determined
or her very existence denied by that supreme tribunal. If
the subjective idealism of Protagoras and Gorgias made for
spiritualism, so also did the teleological religion of Socrates.
It was impossible to assert the priority and superiority of
mind to matter more strongly than by teaching that a
designing intelligence had created the whole visible universe
for the exclusive enjoyment of man. The infinite without
was in its turn absorbed by the infinite within. Finally, the
logical method of Socrates contained in itself the germs of a
still subtler spiritualism which Plato now proceeded to work
out.</p>

<p>The dialectic theory, considered in its relation to physics,
tended to substitute the study of uniformity for the study of
mechanical causation. But the general conceptions established
by science were a kind of soul in Nature; they were
immaterial, they could not be perceived by sense, and yet,
remaining as they did unchanged in a world of change, they
were far truer, far more real, than the phenomena to which
they gave unity and definition. Now these self-existent
ideas, being subjective in their origin, readily reacted on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
mind, and communicated to it those attributes of fixedness
and eternal duration which had in truth been borrowed by
them from Nature, not by Nature from them. Plato argued
that the soul was in possession of ideas too pure to have
been derived from the suggestions of sense, and therefore
traceable to the reminiscences of an ante-natal experience.
But we can see that the reminiscence was all on the side of
the ideas; it was they that betrayed their human origin by
the birthmark of abstraction and finality—betokening the
limitation of man’s faculties and the interest of his desires—which
still clung to them when from a temporary law of
thought they were erected into an everlasting law of things.
As Comte would say, Plato was taking out of his conceptions
what he had first put into them himself. And, if this
consideration applies to all his reasonings on the subject of
immortality, it applies especially to what he regards as the
most convincing demonstration of any. There is one idea,
he tells us, with which the soul is inseparably and essentially
associated—namely, the idea of life. Without this, soul can
no more be conceived than snow without cold or fire without
heat; nor can death approach it without involving a logical
contradiction. To assume that the soul is separable from
the body, and that life is inseparable from the soul, was
certainly an expeditious method of proof. To a modern, it
would have the further disadvantage of proving too much.
For, by parity of reasoning, every living thing must have an
immortal soul, and every soul must have existed from all
eternity. Plato frankly accepted both conclusions, and even
incorporated them with his ethical system. He looked on
the lower animals as so many stages in a progressive
degradation to which human beings had descended through
their own violence or sensuality, but from which it was
possible for them to return after a certain period of penitence
and probation. At other times he describes a hell, a
purgatory, and a heaven, not unlike what we read of in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
Dante, without apparently being conscious of any inconsistency
between the two representations. It was, indeed, an
inconsistency such as we find in the highest order of intellects,
the inconsistency of one who mediated between two worlds,
between naturalistic metempsychosis on the one side, and
ethical individualism on the other.</p>

<p>It was not merely the immortality, it was the eternity of
the soul that Plato taught. For him the expectation of a life
beyond the grave was identified with the memory of an ante-natal
existence, and the two must stand or fall together.
When Shelley’s shipwrecked mother exclaims to her child:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">‘Alas! what is life, what is death, what are we,</div>
  <div class="verse">That when the ship sinks we no longer may be!</div>
  <div class="verse">What! to see thee no more, and to feel thee no more,</div>
  <div class="verse">To be after life what we have been before!’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Her despair is but the inverted image of Plato’s hope, the
return to a purer state of being where knowledge will no
longer be obscured by passing through the perturbing medium
of sight and touch. Again, modern apologists for the injustice
and misery of the present system<a id="FNanchor_144_144" href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> argue that its inequalities
will be redressed in a future state. Plato conversely regarded
the sufferings of good men as a retribution for former sin, or
as the result of a forgotten choice. The authority of Pindar
and of ancient tradition generally may have influenced his
belief, but it had a deeper ground in the logic of a spiritualistic
philosophy. The dualism of soul and body is only one
form of his fundamental antithesis between the changeless
essence and the transitory manifestations of existence. A
pantheism like Spinoza’s was the natural outcome of such a
system; but his practical genius or his ardent imagination
kept Plato from carrying it so far. Nor in the interests of
progress was the result to be regretted; for theology had to
pass through one more phase before the term of its beneficent
activity could be reached. Ethical conceptions gained a new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
significance in the blended light of mythology and metaphysics;
those who made it their trade to pervert justice at its
fountain-head might still tremble before the terrors of a
supernatural tribunal; or if Plato could not regenerate the
life of his own people he could foretell what was to be the
common faith of Europe in another thousand years; and
memory, if not hope, is the richer for those magnificent visions
where he has projected the eternal conflict between good and
evil into the silence and darkness by which our lives are shut
in on every side.</p>


<h3><a id="V-V"></a>V.</h3>

<p>Plato had begun by condemning poetry only in so far as
it was inconsistent with true religion and morality. At last,
with his usual propensity to generalise, he condemned it and,
by implication, every imitative art <i lang="la">quâ</i> art, as a delusion and
a sham, twice removed from the truth of things, because a copy
of the phenomena which are themselves unreal representations
of an archetypal idea. His iconoclasm may remind us of
other ethical theologians both before and after, whether
Hebrew, Moslem, or Puritan. If he does not share their
fanatical hatred for plastic and pictorial representations, it is
only because works of that class, besides being of a chaster
character, exercised far less power over the Greek imagination
than epic and dramatic poetry. Moreover, the tales of the
poets were, according to Plato, the worst lies of any, since
they were believed to be true; whereas statues and pictures
differed too obviously from their originals for any such illusion
to be produced in their case. Like the Puritans, again, Plato
sanctioned the use of religious hymns, with the accompaniment
of music in its simplest and most elevated forms. Like
them, also, he would have approved of literary fiction when it
was employed for edifying purposes. Works like the <cite>Faery
Queen</cite>, <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>, and the <cite>Pilgrim’s Progress</cite>, would have
been his favourites in English literature; and he might have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
extended the same indulgence to fictions of the Edgeworthian
type, where the virtuous characters always come off best in
the end.</p>

<p>The reformed system of education was to be not only
moral and religious but also severely scientific. The place
given to mathematics as the foundation of a right intellectual
training is most remarkable, and shows how truly Plato
apprehended the conditions under which knowledge is acquired
and enlarged. Here, as in other respects, he is, more
even than Aristotle, the precursor of Auguste Comte. He
arranges the mathematical sciences, so far as they then existed,
in their logical order; and his remarks on the most general
ideas suggested by astronomy read like a divination of rational
mechanics. That a recommendation of such studies should
be put into the mouth of Socrates is a striking incongruity.
The older Plato grew the farther he seems to have advanced
from the humanist to the naturalistic point of view; and, had
he been willing to confess it, Hippias and Prodicus were the
teachers with whom he finally found himself most in sympathy.</p>

<p>Macaulay has spoken as if the Platonic philosophy was
totally unrelated to the material wants of men. This, however,
is a mistake. It is true that, in the <cite>Republic</cite>, science is
not regarded as an instrument for heaping up fresh luxuries,
or for curing the diseases which luxury breeds; but only
because its purpose is held to be the discovery of those
conditions under which a healthy, happy, and virtuous race
can best be reared. The art of the true statesman is to weave
the web of life with perfect skill, to bring together those
couples from whose union the noblest progeny shall issue; and
it is only by mastering the laws of the physical universe that
this art can be acquired. Plato knew no natural laws but
those of mathematics and astronomy; consequently, he set
far too much store on the times and seasons at which bride
and bridegroom were to meet, and on the numerical ratios by
which they were supposed to be determined. He even tells<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
us about a mysterious formula for discovering the nuptial
number, by which the ingenuity of commentators has been
considerably exercised. The true laws by which marriage
should be regulated among a civilised people have remained
wrapped in still more impenetrable darkness. Whatever may
be the best solution, it can hardly fail to differ in many
respects from our present customs. It cannot be right that
the most important act in the life of a human being should
be determined by social ambition, by avarice, by vanity, by
pique, or by accident—in a word, by the most contemptible
impulses of which human nature is susceptible; nor is it to be
expected that sexual selection will always necessitate the
employment of insincerity, adulation, and bribery by one of
the parties concerned, while fostering in the other credulity,
egoism, jealousy, capriciousness, and petty tyranny—the very
qualities which a wise training would have for its object to
root out.<a id="FNanchor_145_145" href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">145</a></p>

<p>It seems difficult to reconcile views about marriage involving
a recognition of the fact that mental and moral qualities
are hereditarily transmitted, with the belief in metempsychosis
elsewhere professed by Plato. But perhaps his adhesion
to the latter doctrine is not to be taken very seriously.
In imitation of the objective world, whose essential truth is
half hidden and half disclosed by its phenomenal manifestations,
he loves to present his speculative teaching under a
mythical disguise; and so he may have chosen the old
doctrine of transmigration as an apt expression for the unity
and continuity of life. And, at worst, he would not be guilty
of any greater inconsistency than is chargeable to those
modern philosophers who, while they admit that mental
qualities are inherited, hold each individual soul to be a
separate and independent creation.</p>

<p>The rules for breeding and education set forth in the
<cite>Republic</cite> are not intended for the whole community, but only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
for the ruling minority. It was by the corruption of the
higher classes that Plato was most distressed, and the salvation
of the State depended, according to him, on their reformation.
This leads us on to his scheme for the reconstitution
of society. It is intimately connected with his method of
logical definition and classification. He shows with great
force that the collective action of human beings is conditioned
by the division of labour; and argues from this that every
individual ought, in the interest of the whole, to be restricted
to a single occupation. Therefore, the industrial classes, who
form the bulk of the population, are to be excluded both
from military service and from political power. The Peloponnesian
War had led to a general substitution of professional
soldiers for the old levies of untrained citizens in Greek
warfare. Plato was deeply impressed by the dangers, as well
as by the advantages, of this revolution. That each profession
should be exercised only by persons trained for it, suited
his notions alike as a logician, a teacher, and a practical
reformer. But he saw that mercenary fighters might use
their power to oppress and plunder the defenceless citizens,
or to establish a military despotism. And, holding that
government should, like strategy, be exercised only by functionaries
naturally fitted and expressly trained for the work,
he saw equally that a privileged class would be tempted to
abuse their position in order to fill their pockets and to gratify
their passions. He proposed to provide against these dangers,
first by the new system of education already described, and
secondly by pushing the division of labour to its logical
conclusion. That they might the better attend to their
specific duties, the defenders and the rulers of the State were
not to practise the art of money-making; in other words,
they were not to possess any property of their own, but were
to be supported by the labour of the industrial classes.
Furthermore, that they need not quarrel among themselves,
he proposed that every private interest should be eliminated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
from their lives, and that they should, as a class, be united by
the closest bonds of family affection. This purpose was to
be effected by the abolition of marriage and of domesticity.
The couples chosen for breeding were to be separated when
the object of their union had been attained; children were to
be taken from their mothers immediately after birth and
brought up at the expense and under the supervision of the
State. Sickly and deformed infants were to be destroyed.
Those who fell short of the aristocratic standard were to be
degraded, and their places filled up by the exceptionally
gifted offspring of low-class parents. Members of the military
and governing caste were to address each other according
to the kinship which might possibly exist between them.
In the absence of home-employments, women were to be, so
far as possible, assimilated to men; to pass through the same
bodily and mental training; to be enrolled in the army;
and, if they showed the necessary capacity, to discharge the
highest political functions. In this practical dialectic the
identifying no less than the differentiating power of logic is
displayed, and displayed also in defiance of common ideas,
as in the modern classifications of zoology and botany. Plato
introduces distinctions where they did not before exist, and
annuls those which were already recognised. The sexes were
to be assimilated, political life was to be identified with family
life, and the whole community was to present an exact
parallel with the individual soul. The ruling committee
corresponded to reason, the army to passionate spirit, and the
industrial classes to the animal desires; and each, in its
perfect constitution, represented one of the cardinal virtues as
reinterpreted by Plato. Wisdom belonged to the ruling part,
courage to the intermediate executive power, and temperance
or obedience to the organs of material existence; while
justice meant the general harmony resulting from the fulfilment
of their appropriate functions by all. We may add
that the whole State reproduced the Greek family in a much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
deeper sense than Plato himself was aware of. For his
aristocracy represents the man, whose virtue, in the words of
Gorgias, was to ‘administer the State;’ and his industrial
class takes the place of the woman, whose duty was ‘to
order her house, and keep what is indoors, and obey her
husband.’<a id="FNanchor_146_146" href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">146</a></p>

<p>Such was the celebrated scheme by which Plato proposed
to regenerate mankind. We have already taken occasion to
show how it was connected with his ethical and dialectical
philosophy. We have now to consider in what relation it
stands to the political experience of his own and other times,
as well as to the revolutionary proposals of other speculative
reformers.</p>


<h3><a id="V-VI"></a>VI.</h3>

<p>According to Hegel,<a id="FNanchor_147_147" href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> the Platonic polity, so far from
being an impracticable dream, had already found its realisation
in Greek life, and did but give a purer expression to the
constitutive principle of every ancient commonwealth. There
are, he tells us, three stages in the moral development of
mankind. The first is purely objective. It represents a
régime where rules of conduct are entirely imposed from
without; they are, as it were, embodied in the framework of
society; they rest, not on reason and conscience, but on
authority and tradition; they will not suffer themselves to be
questioned, for, being unproved, a doubt would be fatal to
their very existence. Here the individual is completely
sacrificed to the State; but in the second or subjective stage
he breaks loose, asserting the right of his private judgment
and will as against the established order of things. This
revolution was, still according to Hegel, begun by the
Sophists and Socrates. It proved altogether incompatible
with the spirit of Greek civilisation, which it ended by
shattering to pieces. The subjective principle found an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
appropriate expression in Christianity, which attributes an
infinite importance to the individual soul; and it appears also
in the political philosophy of Rousseau. We may observe
that it corresponds very nearly to what Auguste Comte
meant by the metaphysical period. The modern State reconciles
both principles, allowing the individual his full development,
and at the same time incorporating him with a
larger whole, where, for the first time, he finds his own reason
fully realised. Now, Hegel looks on the Platonic republic
as a reaction against the subjective individualism, the right of
private judgment, the self-seeking impulse, or whatever else
it is to be called, which was fast eating into the heart of Greek
civilisation. To counteract this fatal tendency, Plato goes
back to the constitutive principle of Greek society—that is to
say, the omnipotence, or, in Benthamite parlance, omnicompetence,
of the State; exhibiting it, in ideal perfection, as the
suppression of individual liberty under every form, more
especially the fundamental forms of property, marriage, and
domestic life.</p>

<p>It seems to us that Hegel, in his anxiety to crush every
historical process into the narrow symmetry of a favourite
metaphysical formula, has confounded several entirely distinct
conceptions under the common name of subjectivity. First,
there is the right of private judgment, the claim of each
individual to have a voice in the affairs of the State, and to have
the free management of his own personal concerns. But this,
so far from being modern, is one of the oldest customs of the
Aryan race; and perhaps, could we look back to the oldest
history of other races now despotically governed, we should
find it prevailing among them also. It was no new nor unheard-of
privilege that Rousseau vindicated for the peoples
of his own time, but their ancient birthright, taken from them
by the growth of a centralised military system, just as it had
been formerly taken from the city communities of the Graeco-Roman
world. In this respect, Plato goes against the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
spirit of his country, and no period of its development, not
even the age of Homer, would have satisfied him.</p>

<p>We have next the disposition of individuals, no longer to
interfere in making the law, but to override it, or to bend it
into an instrument for their own purposes. Doubtless there
existed such a tendency in Plato’s time, and his polity was
very largely designed to hold it in check. But such unprincipled
ambition was nothing new in Greece, however the
mode of its manifestations might vary. What had formerly
been seized by armed violence was now sought after with the
more subtle weapons of rhetorical skill; just as at the present
moment, among these same Greeks, it is the prize of parliamentary
intrigue. The Cretan and Spartan institutions may
very possibly have been designed with a view to checking
this spirit of selfish lawlessness, by reducing private interests
to a minimum; and Plato most certainly had them in his
mind when he pushed the same method still further; but those
institutions were not types of Hellenism as a whole, they only
represented one, and that a very abnormal, side of it. Plato
borrowed some elements from this quarter, but, as we shall
presently show, he incorporated them with others of a widely
different character. Sparta was, indeed, on any high theory
of government, not a State at all, but a robber-clan established
among a plundered population whom they never tried or
cared to conciliate. How little weight her rulers attributed
to the interests of the State as such, was well exhibited during
the Peloponnesian War, when political advantages of the
utmost importance were surrendered in deference to the
noble families whose kinsmen had been captured at Sphactêria,
and whose sole object was to rescue them from the fate
with which they were threatened by the Athenians as a means
of extorting concessions;—conduct with which the refusal of
Rome to ransom the soldiers who had surrendered at Cannae
may be instructively contrasted.</p>

<p>We have, thirdly, to consider a form of individualism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
directly opposed in character to those already specified. It
is the complete withdrawal from public affairs for the sake of
attending exclusively to one’s private duties or pleasures.
Such individualism is the characteristic weakness of conservatives,
who are, by their very nature, the party of timidity and
quiescence. To them was addressed the exhortation of Cato,
<i lang="la">capessenda est respublica</i>. The two other forms of which we
have spoken are, on the contrary, diseases of liberalism. We
see them exemplified when the leaders of a party are harassed
by the perpetual criticism of their professed supporters; or,
again, when an election is lost because the votes of the
Liberal electors are divided among several candidates. But
when a party—generally the Conservative party—loses an
election because its voters will not go to the poll, that is owing
to the lazy individualism which shuns political contests altogether.
It was of this disease that the public life of Athens
really perished; and, so far, Hegel is on the right track; but
although its action was more obviously and immediately fatal
in antiquity, we are by no means safe from a repetition of the
same experience in modern society. Nor can it be said that
Plato reacted against an evil which, in his eyes, was an evil
only when it deprived a very few properly-qualified persons of
political supremacy. With regard to all others he proposed
to sanction and systematise what was already becoming a
common custom—namely, entire withdrawal from the administration
of affairs in peace and war. Hegel seems to forget
that it is only a single class, and that the smallest, in Plato’s
republic which is not allowed to have any private interests;
while the industrial classes, necessarily forming a large majority
of the whole population, are not only suffered to retain
their property and their families, but are altogether thrown
back for mental occupation on the interests arising out of
these. The resulting state of things would have found its
best parallel, not in old Greek city life, but in modern Europe,
as it was between the Reformation and the French Revolution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span></p>

<p>The three forms of individualism already enumerated do
not exhaust the general conception of subjectivity. According
to Hegel, if we understand him aright, the most important
aspect of the principle in question would be the philosophical
side, the return of thought on itself, already latent in physical
speculation, proclaimed by the Sophists as an all-dissolving
scepticism, and worked up into a theory of life by Socrates.
That there was such a movement is, of course, certain; but
that it contributed perceptibly to the decay of old Greek
morality, or that it was essentially opposed to the old Greek
spirit, cannot, we think, be truly asserted. What has been
already observed of political liberty and of political unscrupulousness
may be repeated of intellectual inquisitiveness,
rationalism, scepticism, or by whatever name the tendency in
question is to be called—it always was, and still is, essentially
characteristic of the Greek race. It may very possibly have
been a source of political disintegration at all times, but that
it became so to a greater extent after assuming the form of
systematic speculation has never been proved. If the study
of science, or the passion for intellectual gymnastics, drew
men away from the duties of public life, it was simply as one
more private interest among many, just like feasting, or
lovemaking, or travelling, or poetry, or any other of the
occupations in which a wealthy Greek delighted; not from
any intrinsic incompatibility with the duties of a statesman
or a soldier. So far, indeed, was this from being true, that
liberal studies, even of the abstrusest order, were pursued
with every advantage to their patriotic energy by such citizens
as Zeno, Melissus, Empedocles, and, above all, by Pericles and
Epameinondas. If Socrates stood aloof from public business
it was that he might have more leisure to train others for its
proper performance; and he himself, when called upon to
serve the State, proved fully equal to the emergency. As for
the Sophists, it is well known that their profession was to
give young men the sort of education which would enable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
them to fill the highest political offices with honour and
advantage. It is true that such a special preparation would
end by throwing increased difficulties in the way of a career
which it was originally intended to facilitate, by raising the
standard of technical proficiency in statesmanship; and that
many possible aspirants would, in consequence, be driven
back on less arduous pursuits. But Plato was so far from
opposing this specialisation that he wished to carry it much
farther, and to make government the exclusive business of a
small class who were to be physiologically selected and to
receive an education far more elaborate than any that the
Sophists could give. If, however, we consider Plato not as
the constructor of a new constitution but in relation to the
politics of his own time, we must admit that his whole influence
was used to set public affairs in a hateful and contemptible
light. So far, therefore, as philosophy was represented
by him, it must count for a disintegrating force. But
in just the same degree we are precluded from assimilating
his idea of a State to the old Hellenic model. We must
rather say, what he himself would have said, that it never was
realised anywhere; although, as we shall presently see, a
certain approach to it was made in the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>Once more, looking at the whole current of Greek philosophy,
and especially the philosophy of mind, are we entitled
to say that it encouraged, if it did not create, those other forms
of individualism already defined as mutinous criticism on the
part of the people, and selfish ambition on the part of its chiefs?
Some historians have maintained that there was such a connexion,
operating, if not directly, at least through a chain of
intermediate causes. Free thought destroyed religion, with
religion fell morality, and with morality whatever restraints
had hitherto kept anarchic tendencies of every description
within bounds. These are interesting reflections; but they do
not concern us here, for the issue raised by Hegel is entirely
different. It matters nothing to him that Socrates was a staunch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
defender of supernaturalism and of the received morality.
The essential antithesis is between the Socratic introspection
and the Socratic dialectics on the one side, and the unquestioned
authority of ancient institutions on the other. If this be what
Hegel means, we must once more record our dissent. We
cannot admit that the philosophy of subjectivity, so interpreted,
was a decomposing ferment; nor that the spirit of Plato’s
republic was, in any case, a protest against it. The Delphic
precept, ‘Know thyself,’ meant in the mouth of Socrates:
Let every man find out what work he is best fitted for, and
stick to that, without meddling in matters for which he is not
qualified. The Socratic dialectic meant: Let the whole field
of knowledge be similarly studied; let our ideas on all
subjects be so systematised that we shall be able to discover
at a moment’s notice the bearing of any one of them on any
of the others, or on any new question brought up for decision.
Surely nothing could well be less individualistic, in a bad
sense, less anti-social, less anarchic than this. Nor does
Plato oppose, he generalises his master’s principles; he works
out the psychology and dialectic of the whole state; and if
the members of his governing class are not permitted to have
any separate interests in their individual capacity, each
individual soul is exalted to the highest dignity by having the
community reorganised on the model of its own internal
economy. There are no violent peripeteias in this great
drama of thought, but everywhere harmony, continuity, and
gradual development.</p>

<p>We have entered at some length into Hegel’s theory of the
<cite>Republic</cite>, because it seems to embody a misleading conception
not only of Greek politics but also of the most important
attempt at a social reformation ever made by one man in the
history of philosophy. Thought would be much less worth
studying if it only reproduced the abstract form of a very
limited experience, instead of analysing and recombining the
elements of which that experience is composed. And our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
faith in the power of conscious efforts towards improvement
will very much depend on which side of the alternative we
accept.</p>

<p>Zeller, while taking a much wider view than Hegel, still
assumes that Plato’s reforms, so far as they were suggested
by experience, were simply an adaptation of Dorian practices.<a id="FNanchor_148_148" href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">148</a>
He certainly succeeds in showing that private property, marriage,
education, individual liberty, and personal morality
were subjected, at least in Sparta, to many restrictions resembling
those imposed in the Platonic state. And Plato
himself, by treating the Spartan system as the first form of
degeneration from his own ideal, seems to indicate that this
of all existing polities made the nearest approach to it. The
declarations of the <cite>Timaeus</cite><a id="FNanchor_149_149" href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> are, however, much more distinct;
and according to them it was in the caste-divisions of
Egypt that he found the nearest parallel to his own scheme
of social reorganisation. There, too, the priests, or wise men
came first, and after them the warriors, while the different
branches of industry were separated from one another by
rigid demarcations. He may also have been struck by that
free admission of women to employments elsewhere filled
exclusively by men, which so surprised Herodotus, from
his inability to discern its real cause—the more advanced
differentiation of Egyptian as compared with Greek society.<a id="FNanchor_150_150" href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">150</a></p>


<h3><a id="V-VII"></a>VII.</h3>

<p>But a profounder analysis of experience is necessary
before we can come to the real roots of Plato’s scheme. It
must be remembered that our philosopher was a revolutionist
of the most thorough-going description, that he objected not to
this or that constitution of his time, but to all existing consti<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>tutions
whatever. Now, every great revolutionary movement,
if in some respects an advance and an evolution, is in other
respects a retrogression and a dissolution. When the most
complex forms of political association are broken up, the
older or subordinate forms suddenly acquire new life and
meaning. What is true of practice is true also of speculation.
Having broken away from the most advanced civilisation,
Plato was thrown back on the spontaneous organisation of
industry, on the army, the school, the family, the savage
tribe, and even the herd of cattle, for types of social union.
It was by taking some hints from each of these minor aggregates
that he succeeded in building up his ideal polity, which,
notwithstanding its supposed simplicity and consistency, is one
of the most heterogeneous ever framed. The principles on
which it rests are not really carried out to their logical consequences;
they interfere with and supplement one another.
The restriction of political power to a single class is avowedly
based on the necessity for a division of labour. One man, we
are told, can only do one thing well. But Plato should have
seen that the producer is not for that reason to be made a
monopolist; and that, to borrow his own favourite example,
shoes are properly manufactured because the shoemaker is
kept in order by the competition of his rivals and by the
freedom of the consumer to purchase wherever he pleases.
Athenian democracy, so far from contradicting the lessons of
political economy, was, in truth, their logical application to
government. The people did not really govern themselves,
nor do they in any modern democracy, but they listened to
different proposals, just as they might choose among different
articles in a shop or different tenders for building a house,
accepted the most suitable, and then left it to be carried out
by their trusted agents.</p>

<p>Again, Plato is false to his own rule when he selects his
philosophic governors out of the military caste. If the same
individual can be a warrior in his youth and an administrator<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
in his riper years, one man can do two things well, though
not at the same time. If the same person can be born with
the qualifications both of a soldier and of a politician, and
can be fitted by education for each calling in succession,
surely a much greater number can combine the functions of a
manual labourer with those of an elector. What prevented
Plato from perceiving this obvious parallel was the tradition
of the paterfamilias who had always been a warrior in his
youth; and a commendable anxiety to keep the army closely
connected with the civil power. The analogies of domestic
life have also a great deal to do with his proposed community
of women and children. Instead of undervaluing the family
affections, he immensely overvalued them; as is shown by his
supposition that the bonds of consanguinity would prevent
dissensions from arising among his warriors. He should
have known that many a home is the scene of constant
wrangling, and that quarrels between kinsfolk are the
bitterest of any. Then, looking on the State as a great
school, Plato imagined that the obedience, docility, and
credulity of young scholars could be kept up through a lifetime;
that full-grown citizens would swallow the absurdest inventions;
and that middle-aged officers could be sent into
retirement for several years to study dialectic. To suppose
that statesmen must necessarily be formed by the discipline
in question is another scholastic trait. The professional
teacher attributes far more practical importance to his
abstruser lessons than they really possess. He is not content
to wait for the indirect influence which they may exert at
some remote period and in combination with forces of
perhaps a widely different character. He looks for immediate
and telling results. He imagines that the highest truth
must have a mysterious power of transforming all things into
its own likeness, or at least of making its learners more
capable than other men of doing the world’s work. Here
also Plato, instead of being too logical, was not logical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
enough. By following out the laws of economy, as applied
to mental labour, he might have arrived at the separation of
the spiritual and temporal powers, and thus anticipated the
best established social doctrine of our time.</p>

<p>With regard to the propagation of the race, Plato’s
methods are avowedly borrowed from those practised by
bird-fanciers, horse-trainers, and cattle-breeders. It had long
been a Greek custom to compare the people to a flock of
sheep and their ruler to a shepherd, phrases which still
survive in ecclesiastical parlance. Socrates habitually employed
the same simile in his political discussions; and the
rhetoricians used it as a justification of the governors who
enriched themselves at the expense of those committed to
their charge. Plato twisted the argument out of their hands
and showed that the shepherd, as such, studies nothing but
the good of his sheep. He failed to perceive that the parallel
could not be carried out in every detail, and that, quite apart
from more elevated considerations, the system which secures
a healthy progeny in the one case cannot be transferred to
creatures possessing a vastly more complex and delicate
organisation. The destruction of sickly and deformed
children could only be justified on the hypothesis that
none but physical qualities were of any value to the community.
Our philosopher forgets his own distinction
between soul and body just when he most needed to remember
it.</p>

<p>The position assigned to women by Plato may perhaps
have seemed to his contemporaries the most paradoxical of
all his projects, and it has been observed that here he is in
advance even of our own age. But a true conclusion may be
deduced from false premises; and Plato’s conclusion is not
even identical with that reached on other grounds by the
modern advocates of women’s rights, or rather of their equitable
claims. The author of the <cite>Republic</cite> detested democracy; and
the enfranchisement of women is now demanded as a part of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
the general democratic programme. It is an axiom, at least
with liberals, that no class will have its interests properly
attended to which is left without a voice in the election of
parliamentary representatives; and the interests of the sexes
are not more obviously identical than those of producers and
consumers, or of capitalists and labourers. Another democratic
principle is that individuals are, as a rule, the best
judges of what occupation they are fit for; and as a consequence
of this it is further demanded that women should be
admitted to every employment on equal terms with men;
leaving competition to decide in each instance whether they
are suited for it or not. Their continued exclusion from the
military profession would be an exception more apparent than
real; because, like the majority of the male sex, they are physically
disqualified for it. Now, the profession of arms is the
very one for which Plato proposes to destine the daughters of
his aristocratic caste, without the least intention of consulting
their wishes on the subject. He is perfectly aware that his
own principle of differentiation will be quoted against him,
but he turns the difficulty in a very dexterous manner. He
contends that the difference of the sexes, so far as strength
and intelligence are concerned, is one not of kind but of
degree; for women are not distinguished from men by the
possession of any special aptitude, none of them being able to
do anything that some men cannot do better. Granting the
truth of this rather unflattering assumption, the inference
drawn from it will still remain economically unsound. The
division of labour requires that each task should be performed,
not by those who are absolutely, but by those who are relatively,
best fitted for it. In many cases we must be content
with work falling short of the highest attainable standard,
that the time and abilities of the best workmen may be exclusively
devoted to functions for which they alone are competent.
Even if women could be trained to fight, it does not
follow that their energies might not be more advantageously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
expended in another direction. Here, again, Plato improperly
reasons from low to high forms of association. He appeals
to the doubtful example of nomadic tribes, whose women took
part in the defence of the camps, and to the fighting power
possessed by the females of predatory animals. In truth, the
elimination of home life left his women without any employment
peculiar to themselves; and so, not to leave them completely
idle, they were drafted into the army, more with the
hope of imposing on the enemy by an increase of its apparent
strength than for the sake of any real service which they were
expected to perform.<a id="FNanchor_151_151" href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> When Plato proposes that women of
proved ability should be admitted to the highest political
offices, he is far more in sympathy with modern reformers;
and his freedom from prejudice is all the more remarkable
when we consider that no Greek lady (except, perhaps,
Artemisia) is known to have ever displayed a talent for
government, although feminine interference in politics was
common enough at Sparta; and that personally his feeling
towards women was unsympathetic if not contemptuous.<a id="FNanchor_152_152" href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">152</a>
Still we must not exaggerate the importance of his concession.
The Platonic polity was, after all, a family rather than a true
State; and that women should be allowed a share in the
regulation of marriage and in the nurture of children, was only
giving them back with one hand what had been taken away
with the other. Already, among ourselves, women have a
voice in educational matters; and were marriage brought
under State control, few would doubt the propriety of making
them eligible to the new Boards which would be charged with
its supervision.</p>

<p>The foregoing analysis will enable us to appreciate the
true significance of the resemblance pointed out by Zeller<a id="FNanchor_153_153" href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">153</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
between the Platonic republic and the organisation of mediaeval
society. The importance given to religious and moral training;
the predominance of the priesthood; the sharp distinction
drawn between the military caste and the industrial
population; the exclusion of the latter from political power;
the partial abolition of marriage and property; and, it might
be added, the high position enjoyed by women as regents,
châtelaines, abbesses, and sometimes even as warriors or professors,—are
all innovations more in the spirit of Plato than
in the spirit of Pericles. Three converging influences united
to bring about this extraordinary verification of a philosophical
deal. The profound spiritual revolution effected by Greek
thought was taken up and continued by Catholicism, and unconsciously
guided to the same practical conclusions the
teaching which it had in great part originally inspired. Social
differentiation went on at the same time, and led to the
political consequences logically deduced from it by Plato.
And the barbarian conquest of Rome brought in its train
some of those more primitive habits on which his breach with
civilisation had equally thrown him back. Thus the coincidence
between Plato’s <cite>Republic</cite> and mediaeval polity is due
in one direction to causal agency, in another to speculative
insight, and in a third to parallelism of effects, independent of
each other but arising out of analogous conditions.</p>

<p>If, now, we proceed to compare the <cite>Republic</cite> with more
recent schemes having also for their object the identification
of public with private interests, nothing, at first sight, seems
to resemble it so closely as the theories of modern Communism;
especially those which advocate the abolition not
only of private property but also of marriage. The similarity,
however, is merely superficial, and covers a radical divergence,
For, to begin with, the Platonic polity is not a system of
Communism at all, in our sense of the word. It is not that
the members of the ruling caste are to throw their property
into a common fund; neither as individuals nor as a class do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
they possess any property whatever. Their wants are provided
for by the industrial classes, who apparently continue
to live under the old system of particularism. What Plato
had in view was not to increase the sum of individual enjoyments
by enforcing an equal division of their material means,
but to eliminate individualism altogether, and thus give
human feeling the absolute generality which he so much
admired in abstract ideas. On the other hand, unless we are
mistaken, modern Communism has no objection to private
property as such, could it remain divided either with absolute
equality or in strict proportion to the wants of its holders;
but only as the inevitable cause of inequalities which advancing
civilisation seems to aggravate rather than to redress. So
also with marriage; the modern assailants of that institution
object to it as a restraint on the freedom of individual passion,
which, according to them, would secure the maximum of
pleasure by perpetually varying its objects. Plato would
have looked on such reasonings as a parody and perversion of
his own doctrine; as in very truth, what some of them have
professed to be, pleas for the rehabilitation of the flesh in its
original supremacy over the spirit, and therefore the direct
opposite of a system which sought to spiritualise by generalising
the interests of life. And so, when in the <cite>Laws</cite> he
gives his Communistic principles their complete logical
development by extending them to the whole population, he
is careful to preserve their philosophical character as the
absorption of individual in social existence.<a id="FNanchor_154_154" href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">154</a></p>

<p>The parentage of the two ideas will further elucidate their
essentially heterogeneous character. For modern Communism
is an outgrowth of the democratic tendencies which Plato
detested; and as such had its counterpart in ancient Athens,
if we may trust the <cite>Ecclêsiazusae</cite> of Aristophanes, where also
it is associated with unbridled licentiousness.<a id="FNanchor_155_155" href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> Plato, on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
contrary, seems to have received the first suggestion of his
Communism from the Pythagorean and aristocratic confraternities
of Southern Italy, where the principle that friends
have all things in common was an accepted maxim.</p>

<p>If Plato stands at the very antipodes of Fourier and St.
Simon, he is connected by a real relationship with those
thinkers who, like Auguste Comte and Mr. Herbert Spencer,
have based their social systems on a wide survey of physical
science and human history. It is even probable that his
ideas have exercised a decided though not a direct influence
on the two writers whom we have named. For Comte
avowedly took many of his proposed reforms from the
organisation of mediaeval Catholicism, which was a translation
of philosophy into dogma and discipline, just as Positivism
is a re-translation of theology into the human thought
from which it sprang. And Mr. Spencer’s system, while it
seems to be the direct antithesis of Plato’s, might claim
kindred with it through the principle of differentiation and
integration, which, after passing from Greek thought into
political economy and physiology, has been restored by our
illustrious countryman to something more than its original
generality. It has also to be observed that the application of
very abstract truths to political science needs to be most
jealously guarded, since their elasticity increases in direct
proportion to their width. When one thinker argues from
the law of increasing specialisation to a vast extension of
governmental interference with personal liberty, and another
thinker to its restriction within the narrowest possible limits,
it seems time to consider whether experience and expediency
are not, after all, the safest guides to trust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span></p>


<h3><a id="V-VIII"></a>VIII.</h3>

<p>The social studies through which we have accompanied
Plato seem to have reacted on his more abstract speculations,
and to have largely modified the extreme opposition in which
these had formerly stood to current notions, whether of a
popular or a philosophical character. The change first
becomes perceptible in his theory of Ideas. This is a subject
on which, for the sake of greater clearness, we have hitherto
refrained from entering; and that we should have succeeded
in avoiding it so long would seem to prove that the doctrine
in question forms a much less important part of his philosophy
than is commonly imagined. Perhaps, as some think,
it was not an original invention of his own, but was borrowed
from the Megarian school; and the mythical connexion in
which it frequently figures makes us doubtful how far he ever
thoroughly accepted it. The theory is, that to every abstract
name or conception of the mind there corresponds an objective
entity possessing a separate existence quite distinct from
that of the scattered particulars by which it is exemplified to
our senses or to our imagination. Just as the Heracleitean
flux represented the confusion of which Socrates convicted
his interlocutors, so also did these Ideas represent the definitions
by which he sought to bring method and certainty into
their opinions. It may be that, as Grote suggests, Plato
adopted this hypothesis in order to escape from the difficulty
of defining common notions in a satisfactory manner. It is
certain that his earliest Dialogues seem to place true definitions
beyond the reach of human knowledge. And at the
beginning of Plato’s constructive period we find the recognition
of abstract conceptions, whether mathematical or moral,
traced to the remembrance of an ante-natal state, where the
soul held direct converse with the transcendent realities to
which those conceptions correspond. Justice, temperance,
beauty, and goodness, are especially mentioned as examples<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
of Ideas revealed in this manner. Subsequent investigations
must, however, have led Plato to believe that the highest
truths are to be found by analysing not the loose contents but
the fixed forms of consciousness; and that, if each virtue
expressed a particular relation between the various parts of
the soul, no external experience was needed to make her
acquainted with its meaning; still less could conceptions
arising out of her connexion with the material world be
explained by reference to a sphere of purely spiritual existence.
At the same time, innate ideas would no longer be
required to prove her incorporeality, when the authority of
reason over sense furnished so much more satisfactory a
ground for believing the two to be of different origin. To
all who have studied the evolution of modern thought, the
substitution of Kantian forms for Cartesian ideas will at
once elucidate and confirm our hypothesis of a similar
reformation in Plato’s metaphysics.</p>

<p>Again, the new position occupied by Mind as an intermediary
between the world of reality and the world of appearance,
tended more and more to obliterate or confuse the
demarcations by which they had hitherto been separated.
The most general headings under which it was usual to
contrast them were, the One and the Many, Being and
Nothing, the Same and the Different, Rest and Motion.
Parmenides employed the one set of terms to describe his
Absolute, and the other to describe the objects of vulgar
belief. They also served respectively to designate the wise
and the ignorant, the dialectician and the sophist, the knowledge
of gods and the opinions of men; besides offering
points of contact with the antithetical couples of Pythagoreanism.
But Plato gradually found that the nature of
Mind could not be understood without taking both points of
view into account. Unity and plurality, sameness and
difference, equally entered into its composition; although
undoubtedly belonging to the sphere of reality, it was self<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>-moved
and the cause of all motion in other things. The
dialectic or classificatory method, with its progressive series
of differentiations and assimilations, also involved a continual
use of categories which were held to be mutually exclusive.
And on proceeding to an examination of the summa genera,
the highest and most abstract ideas which it had been sought
to distinguish by their absolute purity and simplicity from
the shifting chaos of sensible phenomena, Plato discovered
that even these were reduced to a maze of confusion and contradiction
by a sincere application of the cross-examining
elenchus. For example, to predicate being of the One was
to mix it up with a heterogeneous idea and let in the very
plurality which it denied. To distinguish them was to
predicate difference of both, and thus open the door to fresh
embarrassments.</p>

<p>Finally, while the attempt to attain extreme accuracy of
definition was leading to the destruction of all thought and
all reality within the Socratic school, the dialectic method
had been taken up and parodied in a very coarse style by a
class of persons called Eristics. These men had, to some
extent, usurped the place of the elder Sophists as paid instructors
of youth; but their only accomplishment was to
upset every possible assertion by a series of verbal juggles.
One of their favourite paradoxes was to deny the reality
of falsehood on the Parmenidean principle that ‘nothing
cannot exist.’ Plato satirises their method in the <cite>Euthydêmus</cite>,
and makes a much more serious attempt to meet it in
the <cite>Sophist</cite>; two Dialogues which seem to have been composed
not far from one another.<a id="FNanchor_156_156" href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> The <cite>Sophist</cite> effects a considerable
simplification in the ideal theory by resolving
negation into difference, and altogether omitting the notions
of unity and plurality,—perhaps as a result of the investiga<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>tions
contained in the <cite>Parmenides</cite>, another dialogue belonging
to the same group, where the couple referred to are
analysed with great minuteness, and are shown to be infected
with numerous self-contradictions. The remaining five ideas
of Existence, Sameness, Difference, Rest, and Motion, are
allowed to stand; but the fact of their inseparable connexion
is brought out with great force and clearness. The enquiry
is one of considerable interest, including, as it does, the
earliest known analysis of predication, and forming an indispensable
link in the transition from Platonic to Aristotelian
logic—that is to say, from the theory of definition and classification
to the theory of syllogism.</p>

<p>Once the Ideas had been brought into mutual relation
and shown to be compounded with one another, the task of
connecting them with the external world became considerably
easier; and the same intermediary which before had linked
them to it as a participant in the nature of both, was now
raised to a higher position and became the efficient cause of
their intimate union. Such is the standpoint of the <cite>Philêbus</cite>,
where all existence is divided into four classes, the limit, the
unlimited, the union of both, and the cause of their union.
Mind belongs to the last and matter to the second class.
There can hardly be a doubt that the first class is either
identical with the Ideas or fills the place once occupied
by them. The third class is the world of experience, the
Cosmos of early Greek thought, which Plato had now
come to look on as a worthy object of study. In the
<cite>Timaeus</cite>, also a very late Dialogue, he goes further, and gives
us a complete cosmogony, the general conception of which
is clear enough, although the details are avowedly conjectural
and figurative; nor do they seem to have exercised
any influence or subsequent speculation until the time of
Descartes. We are told that the world was created by God,
who is absolutely good, and, being without jealousy, wished
that all things should be like himself. He makes it to consist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
of a soul and a body, the former constructed in imitation of
the eternal archetypal ideas which now seem to be reduced to
three—Existence, Sameness, and Difference.<a id="FNanchor_157_157" href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> The soul of
the world is formed by mixing these three elements together,
and the body is an image of the soul. Sameness is represented
by the starry sphere rotating on its own axis; Difference
by the inclination of the ecliptic to the equator;
Existence, perhaps, by the everlasting duration of the
heavens. The same analogy extends to the human figure, of
which the head is the most essential part, all the rest of the
body being merely designed for its support. Plato seems to
regard the material world as a sort of machinery designed to
meet the necessities of sight and touch, by which the human
soul arrives at a knowledge of the eternal order without;—a
direct reversal of his earlier theories, according to which
matter and sense were mere encumbrances impeding the soul
in her efforts after truth.</p>

<p>What remains of the visible world after deducting its ideal
elements is pure space. This, which to some seems the
clearest of all conceptions, was to Plato one of the obscurest.
He can only describe it as the formless substance out of which
the four elements, fire, air, water, and earth, are differentiated.
It closes the scale of existence and even lies half outside it,
just as the Idea of Good in the <cite>Republic</cite> transcends the
same scale at the other end. We may conjecture that the
two principles are opposed as absolute self-identity and
absolute self-separation; the whole intermediate series of forms
serving to bridge over the interval between them. It will
then be easy to understand how, as Aristotle tells us, Plato
finally came to adopt the Pythagorean nomenclature and
designated his two generating principles as the monad and the
indefinite dyad. Number was formed by their combination,
and all other things were made out of number. Aristotle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
complains that the Platonists had turned philosophy into
mathematics; and perhaps in the interests of science it was
fortunate that the transformation occurred. To suppose that
matter could be built up out of geometrical triangles, as Plato
teaches in the <cite>Timaeus</cite>, was, no doubt, a highly reprehensible
confusion; but that the systematic study of science should be
based on mathematics was an equally new and important
aperçu. The impulse given to knowledge followed unforeseen
directions; and at a later period Plato’s true spirit was
better represented by Archimedes and Hipparchus than by
Arcesilaus and Carneades.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that the spontaneous development of
Greek thought should have led to a form of Theism not
unlike that which some persons still imagine was supernaturally
revealed to the Hebrew race; for the absence of any connexion
between the two is now almost universally admitted.
Modern science has taken up the attitude of Laplace towards
the hypothesis in question; and those critics who, like Lange,
are most imbued with the scientific spirit, feel inclined to
regard its adoption by Plato as a retrograde movement. We
may to a certain extent agree with them, without admitting
that philosophy, as a whole, was injured by departing from
the principles of Democritus. An intellectual like an animal
organism may sometimes have to choose between retrograde
metamorphosis and total extinction. The course of events
drove speculation to Athens, where it could only exist on the
condition of assuming a theological form. Moreover, action
and reaction were equal and contrary. Mythology gained as
much as philosophy lost. It was purified from immoral ingredients,
and raised to the highest level which supernaturalism
is capable of attaining. If the <cite>Republic</cite> was the forerunner
of the Catholic Church, the <cite>Timaeus</cite> was the forerunner of
the Catholic faith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span></p>


<h3><a id="V-IX"></a>IX.</h3>

<p>The old age of Plato seems to have been marked by restless
activity in more directions than one. He began various
works which were never finished, and projected others which
were never begun. He became possessed by a devouring
zeal for social reform. It seemed to him that nothing was
wanting but an enlightened despot to make his ideal State a
reality. According to one story, he fancied that such an
instrument might be found in the younger Dionysius. If so,
his expectations were speedily disappointed. As Hegel
acutely observes, only a man of half measures will allow himself
to be guided by another; and such a man would lack the
energy needed to carry out Plato’s scheme.<a id="FNanchor_158_158" href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> However this
may be, the philosopher does not seem to have given up his
idea that absolute monarchy was, after all, the government
from which most good might be expected. A process of
substitution which runs through his whole intellectual evolution
was here exemplified for the last time. Just as in his
ethical system knowledge, after having been regarded solely
as the means for procuring an ulterior end, pleasure, subsequently
became an end in itself; just as the interest in knowledge
was superseded by a more absorbing interest in the
dialectical machinery which was to facilitate its acquisition,
and this again by the social re-organisation which was to
make education a department of the State; so also the
beneficent despotism originally invoked for the purpose of
establishing an aristocracy on the new model, came at last to
be regarded by Plato as itself the best form of government.
Such, at least, seems to be the drift of a remarkable Dialogue
called the <cite>Statesman</cite>, which we agree with Prof. Jowett in
placing immediately before the <cite>Laws</cite>. Some have denied its
authenticity, and others have placed it very early in the entire
series of Platonic compositions. But it contains passages of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
such blended wit and eloquence that no other man could
have written them; and passages so destitute of life that they
could only have been written when his system had stiffened
into mathematical pedantry and scholastic routine. Moreover,
it seems distinctly to anticipate the scheme of detailed legislation
which Plato spent his last years in elaborating. After
covering with ridicule the notion that a truly competent ruler
should ever be hampered by written enactments, the principal
spokesman acknowledges that, in the absence of such a ruler,
a definite and unalterable code offers the best guarantees for
political stability.</p>

<p>This code Plato set himself to construct in his last and
longest work, the <cite>Laws</cite>. Less than half of that Dialogue,
however, is occupied with the details of legislation. The
remaining portions deal with the familiar topics of morality,
religion, science, and education. The first book propounds a
very curious theory of asceticism, which has not, we believe,
been taken up by any subsequent moralist. On the principle
of <i lang="la">in vino veritas</i> Plato proposes that drunkenness should be
systematically employed for the purpose of testing self-control.
True temperance is not abstinence, but the power of resisting
temptation; and we can best discover to what extent any
man possesses that power by surprising him when off his
guard. If he should be proof against seductive influences
even when in his cups, we shall be doubly sure of his constancy
at other times. Prof. Jowett rather maliciously suggests that
a personal proclivity may have suggested this extraordinary
apology for hard drinking. Were it so, we should be reminded
of the successive revelations by which indulgences of
another kind were permitted to Mohammed, and of the one
case in which divorce was sanctioned by Auguste Comte.
We should also remember that the Christian Puritanism to
which Plato approached so near has always been singularly
lenient to this disgraceful vice. But perhaps a somewhat
higher order of considerations will help us to a better under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>standing
of the paradox. Plato was averse from rejecting
any tendency of his age that could possibly be turned to
account in his philosophy. Hence, as we have seen, the use
which he makes of love, even under its most unlawful forms,
in the <cite>Symposium</cite> and the <cite>Phaedrus</cite>. Now, it would appear,
from our scanty sources of information, that social festivities,
always very popular at Athens, had become the chief interest
in life about the time when Plato was composing his <cite>Laws</cite>.
According to one graceful legend, the philosopher himself
breathed his last at a marriage-feast. It may, therefore, have
occurred to him that the prevalent tendency could, like the
amorous passions of a former generation, be utilised for moral
training and made subservient to the very cause with which,
at first sight, it seemed to conflict.</p>

<p>The concessions to common sense and to contemporary
schools of thought, already pointed out in those Dialogues
which we suppose to have been written after the <cite>Republic</cite>, are
still more conspicuous in the <cite>Laws</cite>. We do not mean merely
the project of a political constitution avowedly offered as the
best possible in existing circumstances, though not the best
absolutely; but we mean that there is throughout a desire to
present philosophy from its most intelligible, practical, and
popular side. The extremely rigorous standard of sexual
morality (p. 838) seems, indeed, more akin to modern than to
ancient notions, but it was in all probability borrowed from
the naturalistic school of ethics, the forerunner of Stoicism;
for not only is there a direct appeal to Nature’s teaching in
that connexion; but throughout the entire work the terms
‘nature’ and ‘naturally’ occur with greater frequency, we
believe, than in all the rest of Plato’s writings put together.
When, on the other hand, it is asserted that men can be
governed by no other motive than pleasure (p. 663, B), we seem
to see in this declaration a concession to the Cyrenaic school,
as well as a return to the forsaken standpoint of the <cite>Protagoras</cite>.
The increasing influence of Pythagoreanism is shown by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
the exaggerated importance attributed to exact numerical
determinations. The theory of ideas is, as Prof. Jowett
observes, entirely absent, its place being taken by the distinction
between mind and matter.<a id="FNanchor_159_159" href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">159</a></p>

<p>The political constitution and code of laws recommended
by Plato to his new city are adapted to a great extent from
the older legislation of Athens. As such they have supplied
the historians of ancient jurisprudence with some valuable
indications. But from a philosophic point of view the general
impression produced is wearisome and even offensive. A
universal system of espionage is established, and the odious
trade of informer receives ample encouragement. Worst of
all, it is proposed, in the true spirit of Athenian intolerance,
to uphold religious orthodoxy by persecuting laws. Plato
had actually come to think that disagreement with the vulgar
theology was a folly and a crime. One passage may be
quoted as a warning to those who would set early associations
to do the work of reason; and who would overbear new
truths by a method which at one time might have been used
with fatal effect against their own opinions:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Who can be calm when he is called upon to prove the existence
of the gods? Who can avoid hating and abhorring the men who are
and have been the cause of this argument? I speak of those who
will not believe the words which they have heard as babes and sucklings
from their mothers and nurses, repeated by them both in jest
and earnest like charms; who have also heard and seen their parents
offering up sacrifices and prayers—sights and sounds delightful to
children—sacrificing, I say, in the most earnest manner on behalf
of them and of themselves, and with eager interest talking to the gods
and beseeching them as though they were firmly convinced of their
existence; who likewise see and hear the genuflexions and prostrations
which are made by Hellenes and barbarians to the rising and
setting sun and moon, in all the various turns of good and evil for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>tune,
not as if they thought that there were no gods, but as if there
could be no doubt of their existence, and no suspicion of their non-existence;
when men, knowing all these things, despise them on no
real grounds, as would be admitted by all who have any particle of
intelligence, and when they force us to say what we are now saying,
how can any one in gentle terms remonstrate with the like of them,
when he has to begin by proving to them the very existence of the
gods?<a id="FNanchor_160_160" href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">160</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Let it be remembered that the gods of whom Plato is
speaking are the sun, moon, and stars; that the atheists whom
he denounces only taught what we have long known to be true,
which is that those luminaries are no more divine, no more
animated, no more capable of accepting our sacrifices or responding
to our cries than is the earth on which we tread; and
that he attempts to prove the contrary by arguments which,
even if they were not inconsistent with all that we know about
mechanics, would still be utterly inadequate to the purpose for
which they are employed.</p>

<p>Turning back once more from the melancholy decline of a
great genius to the splendour of its meridian prime, we will
endeavour briefly to recapitulate the achievements which
entitle Plato to rank among the five or six greatest Greeks,
and among the four or five greatest thinkers of all time. He
extended the philosophy of mind until it embraced not only
ethics and dialectics but also the study of politics, of religion,
of social science, of fine art, of economy, of language, and of
education. In other words, he showed how ideas could be
applied to life on the most comprehensive scale. Further, he
saw that the study of Mind, to be complete, necessitates a
knowledge of physical phenomena and of the realities which
underlie them; accordingly, he made a return on the objective
speculations which had been temporarily abandoned, thus
mediating between Socrates and early Greek thought; while
on the other hand by his theory of classification he mediated
between Socrates and Aristotle. He based physical science<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
on mathematics, thus establishing a method of research and
of education which has continued in operation ever since.
He sketched the outlines of a new religion in which morality
was to be substituted for ritualism, and intelligent imitation of
God for blind obedience to his will; a religion of monotheism,
of humanity, of purity, and of immortal life. And he embodied
all these lessons in a series of compositions distinguished
by such beauty of form that their literary excellence alone
would entitle them to rank among the greatest masterpieces
that the world has ever seen. He took the recently-created
instrument of prose style and at once raised it to the highest
pitch of excellence that it has ever attained. Finding the new
art already distorted by false taste and overlaid with meretricious
ornament, he cleansed and regenerated it in that
primal fount of intellectual life, that richest, deepest, purest
source of joy, the conversation of enquiring spirits with one
another, when they have awakened to the desire for truth and
have not learned to despair of its attainment. Thus it was
that the philosopher’s mastery of expression gave added emphasis
to his protest against those who made style a substitute
for knowledge, or, by a worse corruption, perverted it into an
instrument of profitable wrong. They moved along the
surface in a confused world of words, of sensations, and of
animal desires; he penetrated through all those dumb images
and blind instincts, to the central verity and supreme end
which alone can inform them with meaning, consistency,
permanence, and value. To conclude: Plato belonged to
that nobly practical school of idealists who master all the
details of reality before attempting its reformation, and accomplish
their great designs by enlisting and reorganising
whatever spontaneous forces are already working in the same
direction; but the fertility of whose own suggestions it needs
more than one millennium to exhaust. There is nothing in
heaven or earth that was not dreamt of in his philosophy:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
some of his dreams have already come true; others still await
their fulfilment; and even those which are irreconcilable with
the demands of experience will continue to be studied with
the interest attaching to every generous and daring adventure,
in the spiritual no less than in the secular order of
existence.</p>

<small>CHARACTERISTICS OF ARISTOTLE.</small></h2>


<h3><a id="VI-I"></a>I.</h3>

<p>Within the last twelve years several books, both large and
small, have appeared, dealing either with the philosophy of
Aristotle as a whole, or with the general principles on which
it is constructed. The Berlin edition of Aristotle’s collected
works was supplemented in 1870 by the publication of a magnificent
index, filling nearly nine hundred quarto pages, for
which we have to thank the learning and industry of Bonitz.<a id="FNanchor_161_161" href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">161</a>
Then came the unfinished treatise of George Grote, planned on
so vast a scale that it would, if completely carried out, have
rivalled the author’s <cite>History of Greece</cite> in bulk, and perhaps
exceeded the authentic remains of the Stagirite himself. As
it is, we have a full account, expository and critical, of the
<cite>Organon</cite>, a chapter on the <i>De Animâ</i>, and some fragments
on other Aristotelian writings, all marked by Grote’s wonderful
sagacity and good sense. In 1879 a new and greatly
enlarged edition brought that portion of Zeller’s work on
Greek Philosophy which deals with Aristotle and the Peripatetics<a id="FNanchor_162_162" href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">162</a>
fully up to the level of its companion volumes; and
we are glad to see that, like them, it is shortly to appear in
an English dress. The older work of Brandis<a id="FNanchor_163_163" href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> goes over the
same ground, and, though much behind the present state of
knowledge, may still be consulted with advantage, on account
of its copious and clear analyses of the Aristotelian texts.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
Together with these ponderous tomes, we have to mention
the little work of Sir Alexander Grant,<a id="FNanchor_164_164" href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> which, although
intended primarily for the unlearned, is a real contribution
to Aristotelian scholarship, and, probably as such, received
the honours of a German translation almost immediately after
its first publication. Mr. Edwin Wallace’s <cite>Outlines of the
Philosophy of Aristotle</cite><a id="FNanchor_165_165" href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> is of a different and much less popular
character. Originally designed for the use of the author’s own
pupils, it does for Aristotle’s entire system what Trendelenburg
has done for his logic, and Ritter and Preller for all
Greek philosophy—that is to say, it brings together the most
important texts, and accompanies them with a remarkably
lucid and interesting interpretation. Finally we have M.
Barthélemy Saint-Hilaire’s Introduction to his translation of
Aristotle’s <cite>Metaphysics</cite>, republished in a pocket volume.<a id="FNanchor_166_166" href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> We
can safely recommend it to those who wish to acquire a
knowledge of the subject with the least possible expenditure
of trouble. The style is delightfully simple, and that the
author should write from the standpoint of the French spiritualistic
school is not altogether a disadvantage, for that school is
partly of Aristotelian origin, and its adherents are, therefore,
most likely to reproduce the master’s theories with sympathetic
appreciation.</p>

<p>In view of such extensive labours, we might almost
imagine ourselves transported back to the times when Chaucer
could describe a student as being made perfectly happy by
having</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse indent14">‘At his beddes hed</div>
  <div class="verse">Twenty bookes clothed in blake or red</div>
  <div class="verse">Of Aristotle and his philosophie.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It seems as if we were witnessing a revival of Mediaevalism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
under another form; as if, after neo-Gothic architecture, pre-Raphaelitism,
and ritualism, we were threatened with a return
to the scholastic philosophy which the great scientific reformers
of the seventeenth century were supposed to have irrevocably
destroyed. And, however chimerical may seem the hopes of
such a restoration, we are bound to admit that they do actually
exist. One of the most cultivated champions of Ultramontanism
in this country, Prof. St. George Mivart, not
long ago informed us, at the close of his work on <cite>Contemporary
Evolution</cite>, that, ‘if metaphysics are possible, there is
not, and never was or will be, more than one philosophy
which, properly understood, unites all truths and eliminates
all errors—<em>the</em> Philosophy of <em>the</em> Philosopher—Aristotle.’
It may be mentioned also, as a symptom of the same movement,
that Leo XIII. has recently directed the works of
St. Thomas Aquinas to be reprinted for use in Catholic
colleges; having, according to the newspapers, laid aside
300,000 <i lang="it">lire</i> for that purpose—a large sum, considering his
present necessities; but not too much for the republication of
eighteen folio volumes. Now, it is well known that the philosophy
of Aquinas is simply the philosophy of Aristotle, with
such omissions and modifications as were necessary in order
to piece it on to Christian theology. Hence, in giving his
sanction to the teaching of the Angelic Doctor, Leo XIII. indirectly
gives it to the source from which so much of that
teaching is derived.</p>

<p>It may, perhaps, be considered natural that obsolete
authorities should command the assent of a Church whose
boast is to maintain the traditions of eighteen centuries intact.
But the Aristotelian reaction extends to some who stand
altogether aloof from Catholicism. M. Saint-Hilaire speaks
in his preface of theology with dislike and suspicion; he has
recently held office in a bitterly anti-clerical Government;
yet his acceptance of Aristotle’s metaphysics is almost
unreserved. The same tone is common to all official teaching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
in France; and any departure from the strict Peripatetic
standard has to be apologised for as if it were a dangerous
heresy. On turning to our own country, we find, indeed, a
marked change since the time when, according to Mr. Matthew
Arnold, Oxford tutors regarded the <cite>Ethics</cite> as absolutely
infallible. The great place given to Plato in public instruction,
and the rapidly increasing ascendency of evolutionary
ideas, are at present enough to hold any rival authority in
check; still, not only are the once neglected portions of
Aristotle’s system beginning to attract fresh attention—which
is an altogether commendable movement—but we also
find the eminent Oxford teacher, whose work on the subject
has been already referred to, expressing himself as follows:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We are still anxious to know whether our perception of a real
world comes to us by an exercise of thought, or by a simple impression
of sense—whether it is the universal that gives the individual
reality, or the individual that shapes itself, by some process not
explained, into a universal—whether bodily movements are the
causal antecedents of mental functions, or mind rather the reality
which gives truth to body—whether the highest life is a life of
thought or a life of action—whether intellectual also involves moral
progress—whether the state is a mere combination for the preservation
of goods and property, or a moral organism developing the
idea of right. And about these and such like questions Aristotle
has still much to tell us.... His theory of a creative reason,
fragmentary as that theory is left, is the answer to all materialistic
theories of the universe. To Aristotle, as to a subtle Scottish
preacher [Principal Caird] ‘the real pre-supposition of all knowledge,
or the thought which is the <i lang="la">prius</i> of all things, is not the individual’s
consciousness of himself as individual, but a thought or
self-consciousness which is beyond all individual selves, which is the
unity of all individual selves and their objects, of all thinkers and all
objects of all thought.’<a id="FNanchor_167_167" href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">167</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Our critics are not content with bringing up Aristotle as
an authority on the metaphysical controversies of the present
day, and reading into him theories of which he never dreamed:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
they proceed to credit him with modern opinions which he
would have emphatically repudiated, and modern methods
which directly reverse his scientific teaching. Thus Sir A.
Grant takes advantage of an ambiguity in the word Matter,
as used respectively by Aristotle and by contemporary
writers, to claim his support for the peculiar theories of Prof.
Ferrier; although the Stagirite has recorded his belief in the
reality and independence of material objects (if not of what he
called matter) with a positiveness which one would have
thought left no possibility of misunderstanding him.<a id="FNanchor_168_168" href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> And
Mr. Wallace says that Aristotle ‘recognises the genesis of
things by evolution and development;’ a statement which,
standing where it does, and with no more qualifications than
are added to it, would make any reader not versed in the
subject think of the Stagirite rather as a forerunner of Mr.
Darwin and Mr. Herbert Spencer, than as the intellectual
ancestor of their opponents; while, on a subsequent occasion,
he quotes a passage about the variations of plants under domestication,
from a work considered to be un-Aristotelian by
the best critics, apparently with no other object than that of
finding a piece of Darwinism in his author.<a id="FNanchor_169_169" href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">169</a></p>

<p>In Germany, Neo-Aristotelianism has already lived out
the appointed term of all such movements; having, we believe,
been brought into fashion by Trendelenburg about forty
years ago. Since then, the Aristotelian system in all its
branches has been studied with such profound scholarship
that any illusions respecting its value for our present needs
must, by this time, have been completely dissipated; while
the Hegelian dialectic, which it was originally intended to
combat, no longer requires a counterbalance, having been
entirely driven from German university teaching. Moreover,
Lange’s famous <cite>History of Materialism</cite> has dealt a staggering
blow to the reputation of Aristotle, not merely in itself, but
relatively to the services of early Greek thought; although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
Lange goes too far into the opposite extreme when exalting
Democritus at his expense.<a id="FNanchor_170_170" href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> We have to complain, however,
that Zeller and other historians of Greek philosophy start
with an invariable prejudice in favour of the later speculators
as against the earlier, and especially in favour of Aristotle as
against all his predecessors, even Plato included, which leads
them to slur over his weak points, and to bring out his
excellencies into disproportionate relief.<a id="FNanchor_171_171" href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">171</a></p>

<p>It is evident, then, that Aristotle cannot be approached
with the same perfect dispassionateness as the other great
thinkers of antiquity. He is, if not a living force, still a force
which must be reckoned with in contemporary controversy.
His admirers persist in making an authority of him, or at least
of quoting him in behalf of their own favourite convictions.
We are, therefore, bound to sift his claims with a severity
which would not be altogether gracious in a purely historical
review. At the same time it is hoped that historical justice
will not lose, but gain, by such a procedure. We shall be the
better able to understand what Aristotle was, after first
showing what he neither was nor could be. And the utility
of our investigations will be still further enhanced if we can
show that he represents a fixed type regularly recurring in the
revolutions of thought.</p>


<h3><a id="VI-II"></a>II.</h3>

<p>Personally, we know more about Aristotle than about any
other Greek philosopher of the classic period; but what we
know does not amount to much. It is little more than the
skeleton of a life, a bald enumeration of names and dates and
places, with a few more or less doubtful anecdotes interspersed.
These we shall now relate, together with whatever inferences
the facts seem to warrant. Aristotle was born 384 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, at
Stageira, a Greek colony in Thrace. It is remarkable that
every single Greek thinker of note, Socrates and Plato alone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
excepted, came from the confines of Hellenedom and barbarism.
It has been conjectured by Auguste Comte, we know
not with how much reason, that religious traditions were
weaker in the colonies than in the parent states, and thus
allowed freer play to independent speculation. Perhaps, also,
the accumulation of wealth was more rapid, thus affording
greater leisure for thought; while the pettiness of political
life liberated a fund of intellectual energy, which in more
powerful communities might have been devoted to the service
of the State. Left an orphan in early youth, Aristotle was
brought up by one Proxenus, to whose son, Nicanor, he
afterwards repaid the debt of gratitude. In his eighteenth
year he settled at Athens, and attended the school of Plato
until the death of that philosopher twenty years afterwards.
It is not clear whether the younger thinker was quite conscious
of his vast intellectual debt to the elder, and he
continually emphasises the points on which they differ; but
personally his feeling towards the master was one of deep
reverence and affection. In some beautiful lines, still extant,
he speaks of ‘an altar of solemn friendship dedicated to one
of whom the bad should not speak even in praise; who alone,
or who first among mortals, proved by his own life and by
his system, that goodness and happiness go hand in hand;’
and it is generally agreed that the reference can only be to
Plato. Again, in his <cite>Ethics</cite>, Aristotle expresses reluctance to
criticise the ideal theory, because it was held by dear friends
of his own; adding the memorable declaration, that to a
philosopher truth should be dearer still. What opinion Plato
formed of his most illustrious pupil is less certain. According
to one tradition, he surnamed Aristotle the Nous of his school.
It could, indeed, hardly escape so penetrating an observer
that the omnivorous appetite for knowledge, which he
regarded as most especially characteristic of the philosophic
temperament, possessed this young learner to a degree
never before paralleled among the sons of men. He may,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
however, have considered that the Stagirite’s method of
acquiring knowledge was unfavourable to its fresh and vivid
apprehension. An expression has been preserved which can
hardly be other than genuine, so distinguished is it by that
delicate mixture of compliment and satire in which Plato
particularly excelled. He is said to have called Aristotle’s
house the ‘house of the reader.’ The author of the <cite>Phaedrus</cite>,
himself a tolerably voluminous writer, was, like Carlyle, not
an admirer of literature. Probably it occurred to him that a
philosophical student, who had the privilege of listening to his
own lectures, might do better than shut himself up with a
heap of manuscripts, away from the human inspiration of
social intercourse, and the divine inspiration of solitary
thought. We moderns have no reason to regret a habit
which has made Aristotle’s writings a storehouse of ancient
speculations; but from a scientific, no less than from an artistic
point of view, those works are overloaded with criticisms
of earlier opinions, some of them quite undeserving of serious
discussion.</p>

<p>Philosophy was no sooner domiciled at Athens than its
professors came in for their full share of the scurrilous personalities
which seem to have formed the staple of conversation
in that enlightened capital. Aristotle, himself a trenchant
and sometimes a bitterly scornful controversialist, did not
escape; and some of the censures passed on him were, rightly
or wrongly, attributed to Plato. The Stagirite, who had been
brought up at or near the Macedonian Court, and had inherited
considerable means, was, if report speaks truly, somewhat
foppish in his dress, and luxurious, if not dissipated in
his habits. It would not be surprising if one who was left his
own master at so early an age had at first exceeded the limits
of that moderation which he afterwards inculcated as the
golden rule of morals; but the charge of extravagance was
such a stock accusation at Athens, where the continued influence
of country life seems to have bred a prejudice in favour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
of parsimony, that it may be taken almost as an exoneration
from graver imputations; and, perhaps, an admonition from
Plato, if any was needed, sufficed to check his disciple’s ambition
for figuring as a man of fashion.</p>

<p>We cannot tell to what extent the divergences which
afterwards made Plato and Aristotle pass for types of the
most extreme intellectual opposition were already manifested
during their personal intercourse.<a id="FNanchor_172_172" href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> The tradition is that the
teacher compared his pupil to a foal that kicks his mother
after draining her dry. There is a certain rough truth as well
as rough wit about the remark; but the author of the <cite>Parmenides</cite>
could hardly have been much affected by criticisms on
the ideal theory which he had himself reasoned out with equal
candour and acuteness; and if, as we sometimes feel tempted
to conjecture, those criticisms were first suggested to him by
Aristotle in conversation, it will be still more evident that they
were received without offence.<a id="FNanchor_173_173" href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">173</a></p>

<p>In some respects, Aristotle began not only as a disciple
but as a champion of Platonism. On the popular side, that
doctrine was distinguished by its essentially religious character,
and by its opposition to the rhetorical training then in
vogue. Now, Aristotle’s dialogues, of which only a few fragments
have been preserved, contained elegant arguments in
favour of a creative First Cause, and of human immortality;
although in the writings which embody his maturer views, the
first of these theories is considerably modified, and the second
is absolutely rejected. Further, we are informed that Aristotle
expressed himself in terms of rather violent contempt for
Isocrates, the greatest living professor of declamation; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
opened an opposition school of his own. This step has,
curiously enough, been adduced as a further proof of disagreement
with Plato, who, it is said, objected to all rhetorical
teaching whatever. It seems to us that what he condemned
was rather the method and aim of the then fashionable rhetoric;
and a considerable portion of his <cite>Phaedrus</cite> is devoted to
proving how much more effectually persuasion might be produced
by the combined application of dialectics and psychology
to oratory. Now, this is precisely what Aristotle afterwards
attempted to work out in the treatise on Rhetoric still
preserved among his writings; and we may safely assume
that his earlier lectures at Athens were composed on the same
principle.</p>

<p>In 347 Plato died, leaving his nephew Speusippus to
succeed him in the headship of the Academy. Aristotle then
left Athens, accompanied by another Platonist, Xenocrates, a
circumstance tending to prove that his relations with the school
continued to be of a cordial character. The two settled in
Atarneus, at the invitation of its tyrant Hermeias, an old
fellow-student from the Academy. Hermeias was a eunuch
who had risen from the position of a slave to that of vizier,
and then, after his master’s death, to the possession of supreme
power. Three years subsequently a still more abrupt turn of
fortune brought his adventurous career to a close. Like Polycrates,
he was treacherously seized and crucified by order of
the Persian Government. Aristotle, who had married Pythias,
his deceased patron’s niece, fled with her to Mitylênê. Always
grateful, and singularly enthusiastic in his attachments, he
celebrated the memory of Hermeias in a manner which gave
great offence to the religious sentiment of Hellas, by dedicating
a statue to him at Delphi, and composing an elegy, still
extant, in which he compares the eunuch-despot to Heracles,
the Dioscuri, Achilles, and Ajax; and promises him immortality
from the Muses in honour of Xenian Zeus.</p>

<p>When we next hear of Aristotle he is at the Macedonian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
Court,<a id="FNanchor_174_174" href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> acting as tutor to Alexander, the future conqueror of
Asia, who remained under his charge between the ages of
thirteen and sixteen years. The philosopher is more likely to
have obtained this appointment by Court interest—his father
was Court-physician to Alexander’s grandfather, Amyntas—than
by his reputation, which could hardly have been made
until several years afterwards. Much has been made of a connexion
which, although it did not last very long, appeals strongly
to the imagination, and opens a large field for surmise. The
greatest speculative and the greatest practical genius of that
age—some might say of all ages—could not, one would think,
come into such close contact without leaving a deep impression
on each other. Accordingly, the philosopher is supposed
to have prepared the hero for his future destinies. Milton has
told us how Aristotle ‘bred great Alexander to subdue the
world.’ Hegel tells us that this was done by giving him the
consciousness of himself, the full assurance of his own powers;
for which purpose, it seems, the infinite daring of thought was
required; and he observes that the result is a refutation of
the silly talk about the practical inutility of philosophy.<a id="FNanchor_175_175" href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">175</a>
It would be unfortunate if philosophy had no better testimonial
to show for herself than the character of Alexander. It is not
the least merit of Grote’s History to have brought out in full
relief the savage traits by which his conduct was marked from
first to last. Arrogant, drunken, cruel, vindictive, and grossly
superstitious, he united the vices of a Highland chieftain to
the frenzy of an Oriental despot. No man ever stood further
from the gravity, the gentleness, the moderation—in a word,
the Sôphrosynê of a true Hellenic hero. The time came when
Aristotle himself would have run the most imminent personal
risk had he been within the tyrant’s immediate grasp. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
nephew, Callisthenes, had incurred deep displeasure by protesting
against the servile adulation, or rather idolatry, which
Alexander exacted from his attendants. A charge of conspiracy
was trumped up against him, and even the exculpatory
evidence, taken under torture, of his alleged accomplices did
not save him. ‘I will punish the sophist,’ wrote Alexander,
‘and those who sent him out.’ It was understood that his
old tutor was included in the threat. Fortunately, as Grote
observes, Aristotle was not at Ecbatana but at Athens; he
therefore escaped the fate of Callisthenes, who suffered death
in circumstances, according to some accounts, of great atrocity.</p>

<p>Zeller finds several good qualities in Alexander—precocious
statesmanship, zeal for the extension of Hellenic
civilisation, long-continued self-restraint under almost irresistible
temptation, and through all his subsequent aberrations
a nobility, a moral purity, a humanity, and a culture, which
raise him above every other great conqueror; and these he
attributes, in no small degree, to the fostering care of Aristotle;<a id="FNanchor_176_176" href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">176</a>
yet, with the exception of moral purity, which was
probably an affair of temperament, and has been remarked to
an equal extent in other men of the same general character, he
was surpassed, in all these respects, by Julius Caesar; while
the ruthless vindictiveness, which was his worst passion,
exhibited itself at the very beginning of his reign by the
destruction of Thebes. A varnish of literary culture he undoubtedly
had, and for this Aristotle may be thanked; but
any ordinary sophist would probably have effected as much.
As to the Hellenising of Western Asia, this, according to Grote,
was the work, not of Alexander, but of the Diadochi after
him.</p>

<p>The profit reaped by Aristotle from the connexion seems
equally doubtful. Tradition tells us that enormous sums of
money were spent in aid of his scientific researches, and a
whole army of crown servants deputed to collect information<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
bearing on his zoological studies. Modern explorations, however,
have proved that the conquests of Alexander, at least,
did not, as has been pretended, supply him with any new
specimens; nor does the knowledge contained in his extant
treatises exceed what could be obtained either by his own
observations or by private enquiries. At the same time we
may suppose that his services were handsomely rewarded,
and that his official position at the Macedonian Court gave
him numerous opportunities for conversing with the grooms,
huntsmen, shepherds, fishermen, and others, from whom most
of what he tells us about the habits of animals was learned.
In connexion with the favour enjoyed by Aristotle, it must be
mentioned as a fresh proof of his amiable character, that he
obtained the restoration of Stageira, which had been ruthlessly
destroyed by Philip, together with the other Greek cities of
the Chalcidic peninsula.</p>

<p>Two passages in Aristotle’s writings have been supposed
to give evidence of his admiration for Alexander. One is the
description of the magnanimous man in the <cite>Ethics</cite>. The
other is a reference in the <cite>Politics</cite> to an ideal hero, whose
virtue raises him so high above the common run of mortals
that their duty is to obey him as if he were a god. But the
magnanimous man embodies a grave and stately type of
character quite unlike the chivalrous, impulsive theatrical
nature of Alexander,<a id="FNanchor_177_177" href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> while probably not unfrequent among
real Hellenes; and the god-like statesman of the <cite>Politics</cite> is
spoken of rather as an unattainable ideal than as a contemporary
fact. On the whole, then, we must conclude that the
intercourse between these two extraordinary spirits has left
no distinct trace on the actions of the one or on the thoughts
of the other.</p>

<p>On Alexander’s departure for the East, Aristotle returned
to Athens, where he now placed himself at the head of a new
philosophical school. The ensuing period of thirteen years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
was fully occupied by the delivery of public lectures, and by
the composition of those encyclopaedic writings which will
preserve his memory for ever, along, perhaps, with many
others which have not survived. Like Anaxagoras, he was
not allowed to end his days in the city of his adoption. His
youthful attacks on Isocrates had probably made him many
enemies among that rhetor’s pupils. It is supposed by Grote,
but warmly disputed by Zeller, that his trenchant criticisms
on Plato had excited a similar animosity among the sectaries
of the Academy.<a id="FNanchor_178_178" href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> Anyhow, circumstances had unavoidably
associated him with the detested Macedonian party, although
his position, as a metic, or resident alien, debarred him from
taking any active part in politics. With Alexander’s death
the storm broke loose. A charge was trumped up against
Aristotle, on the strength of his unlucky poem in honour of
Hermeias, which was described as an insult to religion. That
such an accusation should be chosen is characteristic of Athenian
bigotry, even should there be no truth in the story that
certain philosophical opinions of his were likewise singled out
for prosecution. Before the case came on for trial, Aristotle
availed himself of the usual privilege allowed on such occasions,
and withdrew to Chalcis, in order, as he said, that the Athenians
need not sin a second time against philosophy. But his
constitution, naturally a feeble one, was nearly worn out. A
year afterwards he succumbed to a stomach complaint, aggravated,
if not produced, by incessant mental application. His
contemporary, Demosthenes, perished about the same time,
and at the same age, sixty-two. Within little more than a
twelvemonth the world had lost its three greatest men; and
after three centuries of uninterrupted glory, Hellas was left
unrepresented by a single individual of commanding genius.</p>

<p>We are told that when his end began to approach, the
dying philosopher was pressed to choose a successor in the
headship of the School. The manner in which he did this is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
characteristic of his singular gentleness and unwillingness to
give offence. It was understood that the choice must lie
between his two most distinguished pupils, Theophrastus of
Lesbos, and Eudêmus of Rhodes. Aristotle asked for specimens
of the wine grown in those islands. He first essayed the
Rhodian vintage, and praised it highly, but remarked after
tasting the other, ‘The Lesbian is sweeter,’ thus revealing his
preference for Theophrastus, who accordingly reigned over the
Lyceum in his stead.<a id="FNanchor_179_179" href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">179</a></p>

<p>A document purporting to be Aristotle’s will has been
preserved by Diogenes Laertius, and although some objections
to its authenticity have been raised by Sir A. Grant,
they have, in our opinion, been successfully rebutted by
Zeller.<a id="FNanchor_180_180" href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> The philosopher’s testamentary dispositions give one
more proof of his thoughtful consideration for the welfare of
those about him, and his devotion to the memory of departed
friends. Careful provision is made for the guardianship of his
youthful children, and for the comfort of his second wife,
Herpyllis, who, he says, had ‘been good to’ him. Certain
slaves, specified by name, are to be emancipated, and to
receive legacies. None of the young slaves who waited on
him are to be sold, and on growing up they are to be set free
‘if they deserve it.’ The bones of his first wife, Pythias, are,
as she herself desired, to be laid by his. Monuments are to
be erected in memory of his mother, and of certain friends,
particularly Proxenus, who had been Aristotle’s guardian, and
his family.</p>

<p>In person Aristotle resembled the delicate student of
modern times rather than the athletic figures of his predecessors.
He was not a soldier like Socrates, nor a gymnast
like Plato. To judge from several allusions in his works, he
put great faith in walking as a preservative of health—even
when lecturing he liked to pace up and down a shady avenue.
And, probably, a constitutional was the severest exercise that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
he ever took. He spoke with a sort of lisp, and the expression
of his mouth is said to have been sarcastic; but the
traits preserved to us in marble tell only of meditation, and
perhaps of pain. A free-spoken and fearless critic, he was
not over-sensitive on his own account. When told that somebody
had been abusing him in his absence, the philosopher
replied, ‘He may beat me, too, if he likes—in my absence.’
He might be abused, even in his own presence, without
departing from the same attitude of calm disdain, much to the
disappointment of his petulant assailants. His equanimity
was but slightly disturbed by more public and substantial
affronts. When certain honorary distinctions, conferred on
him by a popular vote at Delphi, were withdrawn, probably
on the occasion of his flight from Athens, he remarked with
his usual studied moderation, that, while not entirely indifferent,
he did not feel very deeply concerned; a trait which illustrates
the character of the ‘magnanimous man’ far better than anything
related of Alexander. Two other sayings have an almost
Christian tone; when asked how we should treat our friends,
he replied, ‘As we should wish them to treat us;’ and on
being reproached with wasting his bounty on an unworthy
object, he observed, ‘it was not the person, but the human
being that I pitied.’<a id="FNanchor_181_181" href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">181</a></p>

<p>Still, taking it altogether, the life of Aristotle gives one
the impression of something rather desultory and dependent,
not proudly self-determined, like the lives of the thinkers who
went before him. We are reminded of the fresh starts and
the appeals to authority so frequent in his writings. He is
first detained at Athens twenty years by the attraction of
Plato; and no sooner is Plato gone, than he falls under the
influence of an entirely different character—Hermeias. Even
when his services are no longer needed he lingers near the
Macedonian Court, until Alexander’s departure leaves him
once more without a patron. The most dignified period of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
his whole career is that during which he presided over the
Peripatetic School; but he owes this position to foreign
influence, and loses it with the temporary revival of Greek
liberty. A longer life would probably have seen him return
to Athens in the train of his last patron Antipater, whom, as
it was, he appointed executor to his will. This was just the
sort of character to lay great stress on the evidentiary value
of sensation and popular opinion. It was also the character
of a conservative who was likely to believe that things had
always been very much what they were in his time, and
would continue to remain so ever afterwards. Aristotle was
not the man to imagine that the present order of nature had
sprung out of a widely different order in the remote past, nor
to encourage such speculations when they were offered to him
by others. He would not readily believe that phenomena, as
he knew them, rested on a reality which could neither be seen
nor felt. Nor, finally, could he divine the movements which
were slowly undermining the society in which he lived, still less
construct an ideal polity for its reorganisation on a higher
and broader basis. And here we at once become conscious
of the chief difference separating him from his master, Plato.</p>


<h3><a id="VI-III"></a>III.</h3>

<p>It is an often-quoted observation of Friedrich Schlegel’s
that every man is born either a Platonist or an Aristotelian.
If we narrow the remark to the only class which, perhaps, its
author recognised as human beings, namely, all thinking men,
it will be found to contain a certain amount of truth, though
probably not what Schlegel intended; at any rate something
requiring to be supplemented by other truths before its full
meaning can be understood. The common opinion seems to
be that Plato was a transcendentalist, while Aristotle was an
experientialist; and that this constitutes the most typical
distinction between them. It would, however, be a mistake to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
suppose that the <i lang="la">à priori</i> and <i lang="la">à posteriori</i> methods were marked
off with such definiteness in Plato’s time as to render possible
a choice between them. The opposition was not between
general propositions and particular facts, but between the
most comprehensive and the most limited notions. It was as
if the question were now to be raised whether we should begin
to teach physiology by at once dividing the organic from the
inorganic world, or by directing the learner’s attention to some
one vital act. Now, we are expressly told that Plato hesitated
between these two methods; and in his Dialogues, at least,
we find the easier and more popular one employed by preference.
It is true that he often appeals to wide principles which
do not rest on an adequate basis of experimental evidence;
but Aristotle does so also, more frequently even, and, as the
event proved, with more fatal injury to the advance of knowledge.
In his <cite>Rhetoric</cite> he even goes beyond Plato, constructing
the entire art from the general principles of dialectics,
psychology, and ethics, without any reference, except for the
sake of illustration, to existing models of eloquence.</p>

<p>According to Sir A. Grant, it is by the mystical and
poetical side of his nature that Plato differs from Aristotle.
The one ‘aspired to a truth above the truth of scientific
knowledge’; the other to ‘methodised experience and the
definite.’<a id="FNanchor_182_182" href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> Now, setting aside the question whether there is
any truth above the truth of scientific knowledge, we doubt
very much whether Plato believed in its existence. He held
that the most valuable truth was that which could be imparted
to others by a process even more rigorous than mathematical
reasoning; and there was no reality, however transcendent,
that he did not hope to bring within the grasp of a dialectic
without which even the meanest could not be understood.
He did, indeed, believe that, so far, the best and wisest of
mankind had owed much more to a divinely implanted instinct
than to any conscious chain of reflection; but he distinctly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
asserted the inferiority of such guidance to the light of
scientific knowledge, if this could be obtained, as he hoped
that it could. On the other hand, Aristotle was probably
superior to Plato as a poet; and in speaking about the highest
realities he uses language which, though less rich and ornate
than his master’s, is not inferior to it in force and fervour;
while his metaphysical theories contain a large element of
what would now be considered mysticism, that is, he often
sees evidence of purpose and animation where they do not
really exist. His advantage in definiteness is, of course, indisputable,
but this was, perhaps, because he came after Plato
and profited by his lessons.</p>

<p>Yet there <em>was</em> a difference between them, marking off each
as the head of a whole School much wider than the Academy
or the Lyceum; a difference which we can best express by
saying that Plato was pre-eminently a practical, Aristotle
pre-eminently a speculative genius. The object of the one
was to reorganise all human life, that of the other to reorganise
all human knowledge. Had the one lived earlier,
he would more probably have been a great statesman or a
great general than a great writer; the other would at no time
have been anything but a philosopher, a mathematician, or a
historian. Even from birth they seemed to be respectively
marked out for an active and for a contemplative life: the
one, a citizen of the foremost State in Hellas, sprung from a
family in which political ambition was hereditary, himself
strong, beautiful, fascinating, eloquent, and gifted with the
keenest insight into men’s capacities and motives; the other
a Stagirite and an Asclepiad, that is to say, without opportunities
for a public career, and possessing a hereditary aptitude
for anatomy and natural history, fitted by his insignificant
person and delicate constitution for sedentary pursuits,
and better able to acquire a knowledge even of human nature
from books than from a living converse with men and affairs.
Of course, we are not for a moment denying to Plato a fore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>most
place among the masters of those who know; he
embraced all the science of his age, and to a great extent
marked out the course which the science of future ages was to
pursue; nevertheless, for him, knowledge was not so much
an end in itself as a means for the attainment of other ends,
among which the preservation of the State seems to have
been, in his eyes, the most important.<span class="ref"><a href="#M">M</a></span> Aristotle, on the other
hand, after declaring happiness to be the supreme end, defines
it as an energising of man’s highest nature, which again he identifies
with the reasoning process or cognition in its purest form.</p>

<p>The same fundamental difference comes out strongly in
their respective theologies. Plato starts with the conception
that God is good, and being good wishes everything to resemble
himself; an assumption from which the divine origin
and providential government of the world are deduced.
Aristotle thinks of God as exclusively occupied in self-contemplation,
and only acting on Nature through the love which
his perfection inspires. If, further, we consider in what relation
the two philosophies stand to ethics, we shall find that, to
Plato, its problems were the most pressing of any, that they
haunted him through his whole life, and that he made contributions
of extraordinary value towards their solution; while
to Aristotle, it was merely a branch of natural history, a study
of the different types of character to be met with in Greek
society, without the faintest perception that conduct required
to be set on a wider and firmer basis than the conventional
standards of his age. Hence it is that, in reading Plato, we
are perpetually reminded of the controversies still raging
among ourselves. He gives us an exposition, to which
nothing has ever been added, of the theory now known as
Egoistic Hedonism; he afterwards abandons that theory, and
passes on to the social side of conduct, the necessity of justice,
the relation of private to public interest, the bearing of religion,
education, and social institutions on morality, along with
other kindred topics, which need not be further specified, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
they have been discussed with sufficient fulness in the preceding
chapter. Aristotle, on the contrary, takes us back into
old Greek life as it was before the days of Socrates, noticing
the theories of that great reformer only that he may reject
them in favour of a narrow, common-sense standard. Virtuous
conduct, he tells us, consists in choosing a mean between two
extremes. If we ask how the proper mean is to be discovered,
he refers us to a faculty called φρόνησις, or practical reason;
but on further enquiry it turns out that this faculty is possessed
by none who are not already virtuous. To the question, How
are men made moral? he answers, By acquiring moral
habits; which amounts to little more than a restatement of
the problem, or, at any rate, suggests another more difficult
question—How are good habits acquired?</p>

<p>An answer might conceivably have been supplied, had
Aristotle been enable to complete that sketch of an ideal
State which was originally intended to form part of his
<cite>Politics</cite>. But the philosopher evidently found that to do so
was beyond his powers. If the seventh and eighth books of
that treatise, which contain the fragmentary attempt in question,
had originally occupied the place where they now stand
in our manuscripts, it might have been supposed that Aristotle’s
labours were interrupted by death. Modern criticism has
shown, however, that they should follow immediately after
the first three books, and that the author broke off, almost at
the beginning of his ideal polity, to take up the much more
congenial task of analysing and criticising the actually existing
Hellenic constitutions. But the little that he has done proves
him to have been profoundly unfitted for the task of a practical
reformer. What few actual recommendations it contains
are a compromise—somewhat in the spirit of Plato’s <cite>Laws</cite>—between
the <cite>Republic</cite> and real life. The rest is what he never
fails to give us—a mass of details about matters of fact, and
a summary of his speculative ethics, along with counsels of
moderation in the spirit of his practical ethics; but not one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
practical principle of any value, not one remark to show that
he understood what direction history was taking, or that he
had mastered the elements of social reform as set forth in
Plato’s works. The progressive specialisation of political
functions; the necessity of a spiritual power; the formation
of a trained standing army; the admission of women to public
employments; the elevation of the whole race by artificial
selection; the radical reform of religion; the reconstitution of
education, both literary and scientific, the redistribution of
property; the enactment of a new code; the use of public
opinion as an instrument of moralisation;—these are the ideas
which still agitate the minds of men, and they are also the
ideas of the <cite>Republic</cite>, the <cite>Statesman</cite>, and the <cite>Laws</cite>. Aristotle,
on the other hand, occupies himself chiefly with discussing
how far a city should be built from the sea, whether it should
be fortified; how its citizens should <em>not</em> be employed; when
people should <em>not</em> marry; what children should <em>not</em> be permitted
to see; and what music they should <em>not</em> be taught.
Apart from his enthusiasm for philosophy, there is nothing
generous, nothing large-minded, nothing inspiring. The territory
of the city is to be self-sufficing, that it may be isolated
from other States; the citizens are to keep aloof from all industrial
occupations; science is put out of relation to the
material well-being of mankind. It was, in short, to be a
city where every gentleman should hold an idle fellowship; a
city where Aristotle could live without molestation, and in the
enjoyment of congenial friendships; just as the God of his
system was a still higher Aristotle, perpetually engaged in the
study of formal logic.</p>

<p>Even in his much-admired criticisms on the actually existing
types of government our philosopher shows practical weakness
and vacillation of character. There is a good word for
them all—for monarchy, for aristocracy, for middle-class rule,
and even for pure democracy.<a id="FNanchor_183_183" href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> The fifth book, treating of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
political revolutions, is unquestionably the ablest and most
interesting in the whole work; but when Aristotle quits the
domain of natural history for that of practical suggestions, with
a view to obviate the dangers pointed out, he can think of
nothing better than the old advice—to be moderate, even
where the constitutions which moderation is to preserve are
by their very nature so excessive that their readjustment and
equilibration would be equivalent to their destruction. And
in fact, Aristotle’s proposals amount to this—that government
by the middle class should be established wherever the ideal
aristocracy of education is impracticable; or else a government
in which the class interests of rich and poor should be
so nicely balanced as to obviate the danger of oligarchic or
democratic injustice. His error lay in not perceiving that the
only possible means of securing such a happy mean was to
break through the narrow circle of Greek city life; to continue
the process which had united families into villages, and
villages into towns; to confederate groups of cities into larger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
states; and so, by striking an average of different inequalities,
to minimise the risk of those incessant revolutions which had
hitherto secured the temporary triumph of alternate factions
at the expense of their common interest. And, in fact, the
spontaneous process of aggregation, which Aristotle did not
foresee, has alone sufficed to remedy the evils which he saw,
but could not devise any effectual means of curing, and at the
same time has bred new evils of which his diagnosis naturally
took no account.</p>

<p>But, if this be so, it follows that Mr. Edwin Wallace’s
appeal to Aristotle as an authority worth consulting on our
present social difficulties cannot be upheld. Take the question
quoted by Mr. Wallace himself: ‘Whether the State is a
mere combination for the preservation of goods and property,
or a moral organism developing the idea of right?’ Aristotle
certainly held very strong opinions in favour of State interference
with education and private morality, if that is what the
second alternative implies; but does it follow that he would
agree with those who advocate a similar supervision at the
present day? By no means; because experience has shown
that in enormous industrial societies like ours, protection is
attended with difficulties and dangers which he could no more
foresee than he could foresee the discoveries on which our
physical science is based. Or, returning for a moment to
ethics, let us take another of Mr. Wallace’s problems:
‘Whether intellectual also involves moral progress?’ What
possible light can be thrown on it by Aristotle’s exposure of
the powerlessness of right knowledge to make an individual
virtuous, when writers like Buckle have transferred the whole
question from a particular to a general ground; from the
conduct of individuals to the conduct of men acting in large
masses, and over vast periods of time? Or, finally, take the
question which forms a point of junction between Aristotle’s
ethics and his politics: ‘Whether the highest life is a life of
thought or a life of action?’ Of what importance is his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
decision to us, who attend far more to the social than to the
individual consequences of actions; who have learned to take
into account the emotional element of happiness, which Aristotle
neglected; who are uninfluenced by his appeal to the
blissful theorising of gods in whom we do not believe; for
whom, finally, experience has altogether broken down the
antithesis between knowledge and practice, by showing that
speculative ideas may revolutionise the whole of life? Aristotle
is an interesting historical study; but we are as far beyond
him in social as in physical science.</p>


<h3><a id="VI-IV"></a>IV.</h3>

<p>On turning to Aristotle’s <cite>Rhetoric</cite> we find that, from a
practical point of view, his failure here is, if possible, still
more complete. This treatise contains, as we have already
observed, an immense mass of more or less valuable information
on the subject of psychology, ethics, and dialectic,
but gives exceedingly little advice about the very essence of
rhetoric as an art, which is to say whatever you have to say
in the most telling manner, by the arrangement of topics and
arguments, by the use of illustrations, and by the choice of
language; and that little is to be found in the third book,
the genuineness of which is open to very grave suspicion. It
may be doubted whether any orator or critic of oratory was
ever benefited in the slightest degree by the study of
Aristotle’s rules. His collections of scientific data add
nothing to our knowledge, but only throw common experience
into abstract formulas; and even as a body of memoranda
they would be useless, for no memory could contain them, or
if any man could remember them he would have intellect
enough not to require them.<a id="FNanchor_184_184" href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> The professional teachers whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
Aristotle so heartily despised seem to have followed a much
more effectual method than his; they gave their pupils ready-made
speeches to analyse and learn by heart, rightly trusting
to the imitative instinct to do the rest. He compares them
to a master who should teach his apprentices how to make
shoes by supplying them with a great variety of ready-made
pairs. But this would be a much better plan than to give
them an elaborate lecture on the anatomy of the foot, with a
full enumeration of its bones, muscles, tendons, nerves, and
blood-vessels, which is the most appropriate parallel to <em>his</em>
system of instruction.</p>

<p>The <cite>Poetics</cite> of Aristotle contains some hints on the subject
of composition which entitle it to be mentioned in the present
connexion. The deficiencies, even from a purely theoretical
point of view, of this work, once pronounced infallible, have at
last become so obvious that elaborate hypotheses have been
constructed, according to which the recension handed down to
us is a mere mutilated extract from the original treatise.
Enough, however, remains to convince us that poetry was not,
any more than eloquence, a subject with which Aristotle was
fitted to cope. He begins by defining it, in common with all
other art, as an imitation. Here, we at once recognise the
spirit of a philosophy, the whole power and interest of which
lay in knowledge; and, in fact, he tells us that the love of
art is derived from the love of knowledge. But the truth
seems to be that aesthetic enjoyment is due to an ideal
exercise of our faculties, among which the power of perceiving
identities is sometimes, though not always, included. That
the materials of which every artistic creation is composed are
taken from the world of our experience makes no difference;
for it is by the new forms in which they are arranged that we
are interested, not because we remember having met them in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
some natural combination already. Aristotle could not help
seeing that this was true in the case of music at least; and he
can only save his principle by treating musical effects as
representations of passions in the soul. To say, however, that
musical pleasure arises from a perception of resemblance
between certain sounds and the emotions with which they are
associated, would be an extremely forced interpretation; the
pleasure is due rather to a sympathetic participation in the
emotion itself. And when Aristotle goes on to tell us that
the characters imitated in epic and dramatic poetry may be
either better or worse than in ordinary life, he is obviously
admitting other aesthetic motives not accounted for by his
general theory. If, on the other hand, we start with ideal
energising as the secret of aesthetic emotion, we can easily
understand how an imaginary exaltation of our faculties is
yielded by the spectacle of something either rising above, or
falling below, the level on which we stand. In the one case
we become momentarily invested with the strength put into
action before our eyes; in the other, the consciousness of our
own superiority amounts to a fund of reserve power, which
<em>not</em> being put into action, is entirely available for ideal
enjoyment. And, if this be the correct view, it will follow
that Aristotle was quite wrong when he declared the plot to
be more important than the characters of a drama. The
reason given for his preference is, even on the principles of his
own philosophy, a bad one. He says that there can be plot
without character-drawing, but never character-drawing
without plot. Yet he has taught us elsewhere that the human
soul is of more value than the physical organism on which its
existence depends. This very parallel suggests itself to him
in his <cite>Poetics</cite>; but, by an almost inconceivable misjudgment,
it is the plot which he likens to the soul of the piece, whereas
in truth it should be compared to the body. The practice
and preference of his own time may have helped to mislead
him, for he argues (rather inconsistently, by the way) that plot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
must be more indispensable, as young writers are able to
construct good stories before they are able to portray
character; and more artistic, as it was developed much later
in the historical evolution of tragedy. Fortunately for
us, the Alexandrian critics were guided by other canons
of taste, or the structurally faulty pieces of Aeschylus might
have been neglected, and the ingeniously constructed pieces
of Agathon preserved in their place.</p>

<p>It is probable, however, that Aristotle’s partiality was
determined more by the systematising and analytical character
of his own genius than by the public opinion of his age; or
rather, the same tendency was at work in philosophy and in
art at the same time, and the theories of the one were unconsciously
pre-adapted to the productions of the other. In both
there was a decay of penetration and of originality, of life and
of inspiration; in both a great development of whatever could
be obtained by technical proficiency; in both an extension of
surface at the expense of depth, a gain of fluency, and a loss
of force. But poetry lost far more than philosophy by the
change; and so the works of the one have perished while the
works of the other have survived.</p>

<p>Modern literature offers abundant materials for testing
Aristotle’s theory, and the immense majority of critics have
decided against it. Even among fairly educated readers few
would prefer Molière’s <cite>L’Étourdi</cite> to his <cite>Misanthrope</cite>, or
Schiller’s <cite>Maria Stuart</cite> to Goethe’s <cite>Faust</cite>, or Lord Lytton’s
<cite>Lucretia</cite> to George Eliot’s <cite>Romola</cite>, or Dickens’s <cite>Tale of Two
Cities</cite> to the same writer’s <cite>Nicholas Nickleby</cite>, or his <cite>Great
Expectations</cite> to his <cite>David Copperfield</cite>, although in each
instance the work named first has the better plot of the two.</p>

<p>Characters, then, are not introduced that they may perform
actions; but actions are represented for the sake of the characters
who do them, or who suffer by them. It is not so
much a ghostly apparition or a murder which interests us as
the fact that the ghost appears to Hamlet, and that the murder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
is committed by Macbeth. And the same is true of the
Greek drama, though not perhaps to the same extent. We
may care for Oedipus chiefly on account of his adventures;
but we care far more for what Prometheus or Clytemnestra,
Antigone or Ajax, say about themselves than for what they
suffer or what they do. Thus, and thus only, are we enabled
to understand the tragic element in poetry, the production of
pleasure by the spectacle of pain. It is not the satisfaction
caused by seeing a skilful imitation of reality, for few have
witnessed such awful events in real life as on the stage; nor
is it pain, as such, which interests us, for the scenes of torture
exhibited in some Spanish and Bolognese paintings do not
gratify, they revolt and disgust an educated taste. The true
tragic emotion is produced, not by the suffering itself, but by
the reaction of the characters against it; for this gives, more
than anything else, the idea of a force with which we can
synergise, because it is purely mental; or by the helpless submission
of the victims whom we wish to assist because they are
lovable, and whom we love still more from our inability to assist
them, through the transformation of arrested action into feeling,
accompanied by the enjoyment proper to tender emotion.
Hence the peculiar importance of the female parts in dramatic
poetry. Aristotle tells us that it is bad art to represent
women as nobler and braver than men, because they are not
so in reality.<a id="FNanchor_185_185" href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> Nevertheless, he should have noticed that on
the tragic stage of Athens women first competed with men,
then equalled, and finally far surpassed them in loftiness of
character.<a id="FNanchor_186_186" href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> But with his philosophy he could not see that, if
heroines did not exist, it would be necessary to create them.
For, if women are conceived as reacting against outward circumstances
at all, their very helplessness will lead to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
storing of a greater mental tension in the shape of excited
thought and feeling debarred from any manifestation except
in words; and it is exactly with this mental tension that the
spectator can most easily synergise. The wrath of Orestes is
not interesting, because it is entirely absorbed into the premeditation
and execution of his vengeance. The passion of
Electra is profoundly interesting, because it has no outlet but
impotent denunciations of her oppressors, and abortive
schemes for her deliverance from their yoke. Hence, also,
Shakspeare produces some of his greatest effects by placing
his male characters, to some extent, in the position of women,
either through their natural weakness and indecision, as with
Hamlet, and Brutus, and Macbeth, or through the paralysis of
unproved suspicion, as with Othello; while the greatest of all
his heroines, Lady Macbeth, is so because she has the intellect
and will to frame resolutions of dauntless ambition, and eloquence
to force them on her husband, without either the physical
or the moral force to execute them herself. In all these
cases it is the arrest of an electric current which produces the
most intense heat, or the most brilliant illumination. Again,
by their extreme sensitiveness, and by the natural desire felt
to help them, women excite more pity, which, as we have said,
means more love, than men; and this in the highest degree
when their sufferings are undeserved. We see, then, how
wide Aristotle went of the mark when he made it a rule that
the sufferings of tragic characters should be partly brought on
by their own fault, and that, speaking generally, they should
not be distinguished for justice or virtue, nor yet for extreme
wickedness.<a id="FNanchor_187_187" href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> The ‘immoderate moderation’ of the Stagirite
was never more infelicitously exhibited. For, in order to produce
truly tragic effects, excess of every kind not only may,
but must, be employed. It is by the reaction of heroic fortitude,
either against unmerited outrage, or against the whole
pressure of social law, that our synergetic interest is wound up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
to the intensest pitch. It is when we see a beautiful soul
requited with evil for good that our eyes are filled with the
noblest tears. Yet so absolutely perverted have men’s minds
been by the Aristotelian dictum that Gervinus, the great
Shakspearian critic, actually tries to prove that Duncan, to
some extent, deserved his fate by imprudently trusting himself
to the hospitality of Macbeth; that Desdemona was very
imprudent in interceding for Cassio; and that it was treasonable
for Cordelia to bring a French army into England! The
Greek drama might have supplied Aristotle with several decisive
contradictions of his canons. He should have seen that
the <cite>Prometheus</cite>, the <cite>Antigone</cite>, and the <cite>Hippolytus</cite> are affecting
in proportion to the pre-eminent virtue of their protagonists.
The further fallacy of excluding very guilty characters is, of
course, most decisively refuted by Shakspeare, whose Richard
III., whose Iago, and whose Macbeth excite keen interest by
their association of extraordinary villainy with extraordinary
intellectual gifts.</p>

<p>So far Aristotle gives us a purely superficial and sensational
view of the drama. Yet he could not help seeing that
there was a moral element in tragedy, and he was anxious to
show, as against Plato, that it exercised an improving effect
on the audience. The result is his famous theory of the
Catharsis, so long misunderstood, and not certainly understood
even now. The object of Tragedy, he tells us, is to purify
(or purge away) pity and terror by means of those emotions
themselves. The <cite>Poetics</cite> seems originally to have contained
an explanation of this mysterious utterance, now lost, and
critics have endeavoured to supply the gap by writing eighty
treatises on the subject. The result has been at least to show what
Aristotle did <em>not</em> mean. The popular version of his dictum,
which is that tragedy purges the passions by pity and terror,
is clearly inconsistent with the wording of the original text.
Pity and terror are both the object and the instrument of
purification. Nor yet does he mean, as was once supposed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
that each of these emotions is to counterbalance and
moderate the other; for this would imply that they are
opposed to one another, whereas in the <cite>Rhetoric</cite> he speaks
of them as being akin; while a parallel passage in the
<cite>Politics</cite><a id="FNanchor_188_188" href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> shows him to have believed that the passions are
susceptible of homoeopathic treatment. Violent enthusiasm,
he tells us, is to be soothed and carried off by a strain of
exciting, impassioned music. But whence come the pity and
terror which are to be dealt with by tragic poetry? Not,
apparently, from the piece itself, for to inoculate the patient
with a new disease, merely for the sake of curing it, could do
him no imaginable good. To judge from the passage in the
<cite>Politics</cite> already referred to, he believes that pity and terror
are always present in the minds of all, to a certain extent;
and the theory apparently is, that tragedy brings them to the
surface, and enables them to be thrown off with an accompaniment
of pleasurable feeling. Now, of course, we have a
constant capacity for experiencing every passion to which
human nature is liable; but to say that in the absence of its
appropriate external stimulus we are ever perceptibly and
painfully affected by any passion, is to assert what is not
true of any sane mind. And, even were it so, were we constantly
haunted by vague presentiments of evil to ourselves
or others, it is anything but clear that fictitious representations
of calamity would be the appropriate means for enabling
us to get rid of them. Zeller explains that it is the insight
into universal laws controlling our destiny, the association of
misfortune with a divine justice, which, according to Aristotle,
produces the purifying effect;<a id="FNanchor_189_189" href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> but this would be the purgation
of pity and terror, not by themselves, but by the intellectual
framework in which they are set, the concatenation of
events, the workings of character, or the reference of everything
to an eternal cause. The truth is that Aristotle’s
explanation of the moral effect produced by tragedy is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
irrational, because his whole conception of tragedy is mistaken.
The emotions excited by its highest forms are not
terror and pity, but admiration and love, which, in their ideal
exercise, are too holy for purification, too high for restriction,
and too delightful for relief.</p>

<p>Before parting with the <cite>Poetics</cite> we must add that it
contains one excellent piece of advice to dramatists, which is,
to imagine themselves present at the scenes which they are
supposing to happen, and also at the representation of their
own play. This, however, is an exception which proves the
rule, for Aristotle’s exclusively theoretic standpoint here, as
will sometimes happen, coincides with the truly practical
standpoint.</p>

<p>A somewhat similar observation applies to the art of reasoning,
which it would be possible to compile by bringing
together all the rules on the subject, scattered through the
<cite>Organon</cite>. Aristotle has discovered and formulated every
canon of theoretical consistency, and every artifice of dialectical
debate, with an industry and acuteness which cannot be
too highly extolled; and his labours in this direction have
perhaps contributed more than those of any other single
writer to the intellectual stimulation of after ages; but the
kind of genius requisite for such a task was speculative rather
than practical; there was no experience of human nature in
its concrete manifestations, no prevision of real consequences
involved. Such a code might be, and probably was to a
great extent, abstracted from the Platonic dialogues; but to
work up the processes of thought into a series of dramatic
contests, carried on between living individuals, as Plato has
done, required a vivid perception and grasp of realities which,
and not any poetical mysticism, is what positively distinguishes
a Platonist from an Aristotelian.<a id="FNanchor_190_190" href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">190</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span></p>


<h3><a id="VI-V"></a>V.</h3>

<p>But if Aristotle had not his master’s enthusiasm for
practical reforms, nor his master’s command of all the forces
by which humanity is raised to a higher life, he had, more
even than his master, the Greek passion for knowledge as
such, apart from its utilitarian applications, and embracing
in its vast orb the lowliest things with the loftiest, the most
fragmentary glimpses and the largest revelations of truth.
He demanded nothing but the materials for generalisation,
and there was nothing from which he could not generalise.
There was a place for everything within the limits of his
world-wide system. Never in any human soul did the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
theorising passion burn with so clear and bright and pure a
flame. Under its inspiration his style more than once breaks
into a strain of sublime, though simple and rugged eloquence.
Speaking of that eternal thought which, according to him,
constitutes the divine essence, he exclaims:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>On this principle the heavens and Nature hang. This is that best
life which we possess during a brief period only, for there it is so
always, which with us is impossible. And its activity is pure pleasure;
wherefore waking, feeling, and thinking, are the most pleasurable
states, on account of which hope and memory exist.... And
of all activities theorising is the most delightful and the best, so
that if God always has such happiness as we have in our highest
moments, it is wonderful, and still more wonderful if he has more.<a id="FNanchor_191_191" href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">191</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Again, he tells us that—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If happiness consists in the appropriate exercise of our vital functions,
then the highest happiness must result from the highest activity,
whether we choose to call that reason or anything else which is the
ruling and guiding principle within us, and through which we form
our conceptions of what is noble and divine; and whether this be intrinsically
divine, or only the divinest thing in us, its appropriate
activity must be perfect happiness. Now this, which we call the
theoretic activity, must be the mightiest; for reason is supreme in
our souls and supreme over the objects which it cognises; and it is
also the most continuous, for of all activities theorising is that which
can be most uninterruptedly carried on. Again, we think that some
pleasure ought to be mingled with happiness; if so, of all our proper
activities philosophy is confessedly the most pleasurable, the enjoyments
afforded by it being wonderfully pure and steady; for the
existence of those who are in possession of knowledge is naturally
more delightful than the existence of those who merely seek it. Of
all virtues this is the most self-sufficing; for while in common with
every other virtue it presupposes the indispensable conditions of life,
wisdom does not, like justice and temperance and courage, need
human objects for its exercise; theorising may go on in perfect
solitude; for the co-operation of other men, though helpful, is not
absolutely necessary to its activity. All other pursuits are exercised
for some end lying outside themselves; war entirely for the sake of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
peace, and statesmanship in great part for the sake of honour and
power; but theorising yields no extraneous profit great or small, and
is loved for itself alone. If, then, the energising of pure reason rises
above such noble careers as war and statesmanship by its independence,
by its inherent delightfulness, and, so far as human frailty will
permit, by its untiring vigour, this must constitute perfect human
happiness; or rather such a life is more than human, and man can
only partake of it through the divine principle within him; wherefore
let us not listen to those who tell us that we should have no interests
except what are human and mortal like ourselves; but so far as may
be put on immortality, and bend all our efforts towards living up to
that element of our nature which, though small in compass, is in
power and preciousness supreme.<a id="FNanchor_192_192" href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">192</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Let us now see how he carries this passionate enthusiasm
for knowledge into the humblest researches of zoology:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Among natural objects, some exist unchanged through all eternity,
while others are generated and decay. The former are divinely
glorious, but being comparatively inaccessible to our means of observation,
far less is known of them than we could wish; while
perishable plants and animals offer abundant opportunities of study
to us who live under the same conditions with them. Each science
has a charm of its own. For knowledge of the heavenly bodies
is so sublime a thing that even a little of it is more delightful than
all earthly science put together; just as the smallest glimpse of a
beloved beauty is more delightful than the fullest and nearest revelation
of ordinary objects; while, on the other hand, where there
are greater facilities for observation, science can be carried much
further; and our closer kinship with the creatures of earth is some
compensation for the interest felt in that philosophy which deals with
the divine. Wherefore, in our discussions on living beings we shall,
so far as possible, pass over nothing, whether it rank high or low in
the scale of estimation. For even such of them as displease the
senses, when viewed with the eye of reason as wonderful works of
Nature afford an inexpressible pleasure to those who can enter
philosophically into the causes of things. For, surely, it would be
absurd and irrational to look with delight at the images of such
objects on account of our interest in the pictorial or plastic skill
which they exhibit, and not to take still greater pleasure in a scien<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>tific
explanation of the realities themselves. We ought not then to
shrink with childish disgust from an examination of the lower animals,
for there is something wonderful in all the works of Nature; and we
may repeat what Heracleitus is reported to have said to certain
strangers who had come to visit him, but hung back at the door
when they saw him warming himself before a fire, bidding them
come in boldly, for that there also there were gods; not allowing
ourselves to call any creature common or unclean, because there is
a kind of natural beauty about them all. For, if anywhere, there is a
pervading purpose in the works of Nature, and the realisation of
this purpose is the beauty of the thing. But if anyone should
look with contempt on the scientific examination of the lower
animals, he must have the same opinion about himself; for the
greatest repugnance is felt in looking at the parts of which the
human body is composed, such as blood, muscles, bones, veins, and
the like.<a id="FNanchor_193_193" href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> Similarly, in discussing any part or organ we should consider
that it is not for the matter of which it consists that we care,
but for the whole form; just as in talking about a house it is not
bricks and mortar and wood that we mean; and so the theory of
Nature deals with the essential structure of objects, not with the
elements which, apart from that structure, would have no existence
at all.<a id="FNanchor_194_194" href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">194</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It is well for the reputation of Aristotle that he could
apply himself with such devotion to the arduous and, in his
time, inglorious researches of natural history and comparative
anatomy, since it was only in those departments that he
made any real contributions to physical science. In the
studies which were to him the noblest and most entrancing
of any, his speculations are one long record of wearisome,
hopeless, unqualified delusion. If, in the philosophy of
practice and the philosophy of art, he afforded no real guidance
at all, in the philosophy of Nature his guidance has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
always led men fatally astray. So far as his means of
observation extended, there was nothing that he did not
attempt to explain, and in every single instance he was
wrong. He has written about the general laws of matter and
motion, astronomy, chemistry, meteorology, and physiology,
with the result that he has probably made more blunders on
those subjects than any human being ever made before or
after him. And, if there is one thing more astounding than
his unbroken infelicity of speculation, it is the imperturbable
self-confidence with which he puts forward his fallacies as
demonstrated scientific certainties. Had he been right, it
was no ‘slight or partial glimpses of the beloved’ that would
have been vouchsafed him, but the ‘fullest and nearest
revelation’ of her beauties. But the more he looked the less
he saw. Instead of drawing aside he only thickened and
darkened the veils of sense which obscured her, by mistaking
them for the glorious forms that lay concealed beneath.</p>

<p>Modern admirers of Aristotle labour to prove that his
errors were inevitable, and belonged more to his age than to
himself; that without the mechanical appliances of modern
times science could not be cultivated with any hope of success.
But what are we to say when we find that on one point after
another the true explanation had already been surmised by
Aristotle’s predecessors or contemporaries, only to be scornfully
rejected by Aristotle himself? Their hypotheses may
often have been very imperfect, and supported by insufficient
evidence; but it must have been something more than chance
which always led him wrong when they were so often right.
To begin with, the infinity of space is not even now, nor will
it ever be, established by improved instruments of observation
and measurement; it is deduced by a very simple process of
reasoning, of which Democritus and others were capable,
while Aristotle apparently was not. He rejects the idea
because it is inconsistent with certain very arbitrary assumptions
and definitions of his own, whereas he should have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
rejected them because they were inconsistent with it. He
further rejects the idea of a vacuum, and with it the atomic
theory, entirely on <i lang="la">à priori</i> grounds, although, even in the
then existing state of knowledge, atomism explained various
phenomena in a perfectly rational manner which he could
only explain by unmeaning or nonsensical phrases.<a id="FNanchor_195_195" href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> It had
been already maintained, in his time, that the apparent
movements of the heavenly bodies were due to the rotation
of the earth on its own axis.<a id="FNanchor_196_196" href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> Had Aristotle accepted this
theory one can imagine how highly his sagacity would have
been extolled. We may, therefore, fairly take his rejection
of it as a proof of blind adherence to old-fashioned opinions.
When he argues that none of the heavenly bodies rotate,
because we can see that the moon does not, as is evident from
her always turning the same side to us,<a id="FNanchor_197_197" href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> nothing is needed
but the simplest mathematics to demonstrate the fallacy of
his reasoning. Others had surmised that the Milky Way was
a collection of stars, and that comets were bodies of the same
nature as planets. Aristotle is satisfied that both are appearances
like meteors, and the aurora borealis—caused by the
friction of our atmosphere against the solid aether above it.
A similar origin is ascribed to the heat and light derived
from the sun and stars; for it would be derogatory to the
dignity of those luminaries to suppose, with Anaxagoras, that
they are formed of anything so familiar and perishable as
fire. On the contrary, they consist of pure aether like the
spheres on which they are fixed as protuberances; though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
how such an arrangement can co-exist with absolute contact
between each sphere and that next below it, or how the
effects of friction could be transmitted through such enormous
thicknesses of solid crystal, is left unexplained.<a id="FNanchor_198_198" href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> By a happy
anticipation of Roemer, Empedocles conjectured that the
transmission of light occupied a certain time: Aristotle
declares it to be instantaneous.<a id="FNanchor_199_199" href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">199</a></p>

<p>On passing to terrestrial physics, we find that Aristotle is,
as usual, the dupe of superficial appearances, against which
other thinkers were on their guard. Seeing that fire always
moved up, he assumed that it did so by virtue of a natural
tendency towards the circumference of the universe, as
opposed to earth, which always moved towards the centre.
The atomists erroneously held that all matter gravitated
downwards through infinite space, but correctly explained the
ascent of heated particles by the pressure of surrounding
matter, in accordance, most probably, with the analogy of
floating bodies.<a id="FNanchor_200_200" href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> Chemistry as a science is, of course, an
entirely modern creation, but the first approach to it was
made by Democritus, while no ancient philosopher stood
farther from its essential principles than Aristotle. He
analyses bodies, not into their material elements, but into the
sensuous qualities, hot and cold, wet and dry, between which
he supposes the underlying substance to be perpetually oscillating;
a theory which, if it were true, would make any fixed
laws of nature impossible.</p>

<p>It might have been expected that, on reaching physiology,
the Stagirite would stand on firmer ground than any of his
contemporaries. Such, however, is not the case. As already
observed, his achievements belong entirely to the dominion
of anatomy and descriptive zoology. The whole internal
economy of the animal body is, according to him, designed
for the purpose of creating and moderating the vital heat;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
and in apportioning their functions to the different organs he
is entirely dominated by this fundamental error. It was a
common notion among the Greeks, suggested by sufficiently
obvious considerations, that the brain is the seat of the
psychic activities. These, however, Aristotle transports to
the heart, which, in his system, not only propels the blood
through the body, but is also the source of heat, the common
centre where the different special sensations meet to be
compared, and the organ of imagination and of passion. The
sole function of the brain is to cool down the blood—a
purpose which the lungs also subserve. Some persons
believe that air is a kind of food, and is inhaled in order to
feed the internal fire; but their theory would involve the
absurd consequence that all animals breathe, for all have
some heat. Anaxagoras and Diogenes did, indeed, make
that assertion, and the latter even went so far as to say that
fish breathe with their gills, absorbing the air held in solution
by the water passed through them—a misapprehension, says
Aristotle, which arose from not having studied the final cause
of respiration.<a id="FNanchor_201_201" href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> His physiological theory of generation is
equally unfortunate. In accordance with his metaphysical
system, hereafter to be explained, he distinguishes two
elements in the reproductive process, of which one, that contributed
by the male, is exclusively formative; and the other,
that contributed by the female, exclusively material. The
prevalent opinion was evidently, what we know now to be
true, that each parent has both a formative and a material
share in the composition of the embryo. Again, Aristotle,
strangely enough, regards the generative element in both
sexes as an unappropriated portion of the animal’s nutriment,
the last and most refined product of digestion, and therefore
not a portion of the parental system at all; while other
biologists, anticipating Mr. Darwin’s theory of pangenesis in
a very wonderful manner, taught that the semen is a con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>flux
of molecules derived from every part of the body, and
thus strove to account for the hereditary transmission of
individual peculiarities to offspring.<a id="FNanchor_202_202" href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">202</a></p>

<p>All these, however, are mere questions of detail. It is on
a subject of the profoundest philosophical importance that
Aristotle differs most consciously, most radically, and most
fatally from his predecessors. They were evolutionists, and
he was a stationarist. They were mechanicists, and he was
a teleologist. They were uniformitarians, and he was a dualist.
It is true that, as we mentioned at the beginning of this
chapter, Mr. Edwin Wallace makes him ‘recognise the genesis
of things by evolution and development,’ but the meaning of
this phrase requires to be cleared up. In one sense it is, of
course, almost an identical proposition. The genesis of
things must be by genesis of some kind or other. The
great question is, what things have been evolved, and how
have they been evolved? Modern science tells us, that not
only have all particular aggregates of matter and motion
now existing come into being within a finite period of time,
but also that the specific types under which we arrange those
aggregates have equally been generated; and that their
characteristics, whether structural or functional, can only be
understood by tracing out their origin and history. And it
further teaches us that the properties of every aggregate
result from the properties of its ultimate elements, which, within
the limits of our experience, remain absolutely unchanged.
Now, Aristotle taught very nearly the contrary of all this.
He believed that the cosmos, as we now know it, had existed,
and would continue to exist, unchanged through all eternity.
The sun, moon, planets, and stars, together with the orbs
containing them, are composed of an absolutely ungenerable,
incorruptible substance. The earth, a cold, heavy, solid
sphere, though liable to superficial changes, has always
occupied its present position in the centre of the universe.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
The specific forms of animal life—except a few which are
produced spontaneously—have, in like manner, been preserved
unaltered through an infinite series of generations.
Man shares the common lot. There is no continuous
progress of civilisation. Every invention and discovery has
been made and lost an infinite number of times. Our
philosopher could not, of course, deny that individual living
things come into existence and gradually grow to maturity;
but he insists that their formation is teleologically determined
by the parental type which they are striving to realise. He
asks whether we should study a thing by examining how it
grows, or by examining its completed form: and Mr. Wallace
quotes the question without quoting the answer.<a id="FNanchor_203_203" href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> Aristotle
tells us that the genetic method was followed by his predecessors,
but that the other method is his. And he goes on
to censure Empedocles for saying that many things in the
animal body are due simply to mechanical causation; for
example, the segmented structure of the backbone, which
that philosopher attributes to continued doubling and twisting—the
very same explanation, we believe, that would be
given of it by a modern evolutionist.<a id="FNanchor_204_204" href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> Finally, Aristotle
assumes the only sort of transformation which we deny, and
which Democritus equally denied—that is to say, the transformation
of the ultimate elements into one another by the
oscillation of an indeterminate matter between opposite
qualities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span></p>


<h3><a id="VI-VI"></a>VI.</h3>

<p>The truth is that while our philosopher had one of the
most powerful intellects ever possessed by any man, it was
an intellect strictly limited to the surface of things. He was
utterly incapable of divining the hidden forces by which
inorganic nature and life and human society are moved. He
had neither the genius which can reconstruct the past, nor
the genius which partly moulds, partly foretells the future.
But wherever he has to observe or to report, to enumerate or
to analyse, to describe or to define, to classify or to compare;
and whatever be the subject, a mollusc or a mammal, a mouse
or an elephant; the structure and habits of wild animals;
the different stages in the development of an embryo bird;
the variations of a single organ or function through the
entire zoological series; the hierarchy of intellectual faculties;
the laws of mental association; the specific types of
virtuous character; the relation of equity to law; the relation
of reason to impulse; the ideals of friendship; the different
members of a household; the different orders in a State; the
possible variations of political constitutions, or within the
same constitution; the elements of dramatic or epic poetry;
the modes of predication; the principles of definition, classification,
judgment, and reasoning; the different systems of
philosophy; all varieties of passion, all motives to action, all
sources of conviction;—there we find an enormous accumulation
of knowledge, an unwearied patience of research, a sweep
of comprehension, a subtlety of discrimination, an accuracy of
statement, an impartiality of decision, and an all-absorbing
enthusiasm for science, which, if they do not raise him to the
supreme level of creative genius, entitle him to rank a very
little way below it.</p>

<p>It was natural that one who ranged with such consummate
mastery over the whole world of apparent reality, should
believe in no other reality; that for him truth should only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
mean the systematisation of sense and language, of opinion,
and of thought. The visible order of nature was present to
his imagination in such precise determination and fulness of
detail that it resisted any attempt he might have made to
conceive it under a different form. Each of his conclusions
was supported by analogies from every other department of
enquiry, because he carried the peculiar limitations of his
thinking faculty with him wherever he turned, and unconsciously
accommodated every subject to the framework which
they imposed. The clearness of his ideas necessitated the use
of sharply-drawn distinctions, which prevented the free play
of generalisation and fruitful interchange of principles between
the different sciences. And we shall have occasion to show
hereafter, that, when he attempted to combine rival theories,
it was done by placing them in juxtaposition rather than by
mutual interpenetration. Again, with his vivid perceptions,
it was impossible for him to believe in the justification of any
method claiming to supersede, or even to supplement, their
authority. Hence he was hardly less opposed to the atomism
of Democritus than to the scepticism of Protagoras or the
idealism of Plato. Hence, also, his dislike for all explanations
which assumed that there were hidden processes at work
below the surface of things, even taking surface in its most
literal sense. Thus, in discussing the question why the sea
is salt, he will not accept the theory that rivers dissolve out
the salt from the strata through which they pass, and carry it
down to the sea, because river-water tastes fresh; and propounds
in its stead the utterly false hypothesis of a dry
saline evaporation from the earth’s surface, which he supposes
to be swept seawards by the wind.<a id="FNanchor_205_205" href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> Even in his own especial
province of natural history the same tendency leads him
astray. He asserts that the spider throws off its web from
the surface of its body like a skin, instead of evolving it from
within, as Democritus had taught.<a id="FNanchor_206_206" href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> The same thinker had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
endeavoured to prove by analogical reasoning that the
invertebrate animals must have viscera, and that only their
extreme minuteness prevents us from perceiving them; a
view which his successor will not admit.<a id="FNanchor_207_207" href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">207</a> In fact, wherever
the line between the visible and the invisible is crossed,
Aristotle’s powers are suddenly paralysed, as if by enchantment.</p>

<p>Another circumstance which led Aristotle to disregard
the happy aperçus of earlier philosophers was his vast
superiority to them in positive knowledge. It never occurred
to him that their sagacity might be greater than his, precisely
because its exercise was less impeded by the labour of acquiring
and retaining such immense masses of irrelevant facts.
And his confidence was still further enhanced by the conviction
that all previous systems were absorbed into his own, their
scattered truths co-ordinated, their aberrations corrected, and
their discords reconciled. But in striking a general average
of existing philosophies, he was in reality bringing them back
to that anonymous philosophy which is embodied in common
language and common opinion. And if he afterwards ruled
the minds of men with a more despotic sway than any other
intellectual master, it was because he gave an organised
expression to the principle of authority, which, if it could,
would stereotype and perpetuate the existing type of civilisation
for all time.</p>

<p>Here, then, are three main points of distinction between
our philosopher and his precursors, the advantage being, so
far, entirely on their side. He did not, like the Ionian
physiologists, anticipate in outline our theories of evolution.
He held that the cosmos had always been, by the strictest
necessity, arranged in the same manner; the starry revolutions
never changing; the four elements preserving a constant
balance; the earth always solid; land and water always
distributed according to their present proportions; living<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
species transmitting the same unalterable type through an
infinite series of generations; the human race enjoying an
eternal duration, but from time to time losing all its conquests
in some great physical catastrophe, and obliged to begin over
again with the depressing consciousness that nothing could
be devised which had not been thought of an infinite number
of times already; the existing distinctions between Hellenes
and barbarians, masters and slaves, men and women,
grounded on everlasting necessities of nature. He did not,
like Democritus, distinguish between objective and subjective
properties of matter; nor admit that void space extends to
infinity round the starry sphere, and honeycombs the objects
which seem most incompressible and continuous to our senses.
He did not hope, like Socrates, for the regeneration of the
individual, nor, like Plato, for the regeneration of the race, by
enlightened thought. It seemed as if Philosophy, abdicating
her high function, and obstructing the paths which she had
first opened, were now content to systematise the forces of
prejudice, blindness, immobility, and despair.</p>

<p>For the restrictions under which Aristotle thought were
not determined by his personality alone; they followed on
the logical development of speculation, and would have imposed
themselves on any other thinker equally capable of
carrying that development to its predetermined goal. The
Ionian search for a primary cause and substance of nature led
to the distinction, made almost simultaneously, although from
opposite points of view, by Parmenides and Heracleitus,
between appearance and reality. From that distinction
sprang the idea of mind, organised by Socrates into a systematic
study of ethics and dialectics. Time and space, the
necessary conditions of physical causality, were eliminated
from a method having for its form the eternal relations of
difference and resemblance, for its matter the present interests
of humanity. Socrates taught that before enquiring whence
things come we must first determine what it is they are.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
Hence he reduced science to the framing of exact definitions.
Plato followed on the same track, and refused to answer a
single question about anything until the subject of investigation
had been clearly determined. But the form of causation
had taken such a powerful hold on Greek thought, that it
could not be immediately shaken off; and Plato, as he devoted
more and more attention to the material universe, saw himself
compelled, like the older philosophers, to explain its construction
by tracing out the history of its growth. What is
even more significant, he applied the same method to ethics
and politics, finding it easier to describe how the various
virtues and types of social union came into existence, than to
analyse and classify them as fixed ideas without reference to
time. Again, while taking up the Eleatic antithesis of reality
and appearance, and re-interpreting it as a distinction between
noumena and phenomena, ideas and sensations, spirit and
matter, he was impelled by the necessity of explaining himself,
and by the actual limitations of experience to assimilate
the two opposing series, or, at least, to view the fleeting,
superficial images as a reflection and adumbration of the being
which they concealed. And of all material objects, it seemed
as if the heavenly bodies, with their orderly, unchanging
movements, their clear brilliant light, and their remoteness
from earthly impurities, best represented the philosopher’s
ideal. Thus, Plato, while on the one side he reaches back to
the pre-Socratic age, on the other reaches forward to the
Aristotelian system.</p>

<p>Nor was this all. As the world of sense was coming back
into favour, the world of reason was falling into disrepute.
Just as the old physical philosophy had been decomposed by
the Sophisticism of Protagoras and Gorgias, so also the
dialectic of Socrates was corrupted into the sophistry of
Eubulides and Euthydêmus. Plato himself discovered that
by reasoning deductively from purely abstract premises, contradictory
conclusions could be established with apparently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
equal force. It was difficult to see how a decision could be
arrived at except by appealing to the testimony of sense. And
a moral reform could hardly be effected except by similarly
taking into account the existing beliefs and customs of mankind.</p>

<p>It is possible, we think, to trace a similar evolution in the
history of the Attic drama. The tragedies of Aeschylus
resemble the old Ionian philosophy in this, that they are
filled with material imagery, and that they deal with remote
interests, remote times, and remote places. Sophocles withdraws
his action into the subjective sphere, and simultaneously
works out a pervading contrast between the illusions by which
men are either lulled to false security or racked with needless
anguish, and the terrible or consolatory reality to which they
finally awaken. We have also, in his well-known irony, in
the unconscious self-betrayal of his characters, that subtle
evanescent allusiveness to a hidden truth, that gleaming of
reality through appearance which constitutes, first the
dialectic, then the mythical illustration, and finally the physics
of Plato. In Aeschylus also we have the spectacle of sudden
and violent vicissitudes, the abasement of insolent prosperity,
and the punishment of long successful crime; only with him
the characters which attract most interest are not the blind
victims, but the accomplices or the confidants of destiny—the
great figures of a Prometheus, a Darius, an Eteocles, a Clytemnestra,
and a Cassandra, who are raised above the common
level to an eminence where the secrets of past and future are
unfolded to their gaze. Far otherwise with Sophocles. The
leading actors in his most characteristic works, Oedipus,
Electra, Dejanira, Ajax, and Philoctetes, are surrounded by
forces which they can neither control nor understand; moving
in a world of illusion, if they help to work out their own
destinies it is unconsciously, or even in direct opposition to
their own designs.<a id="FNanchor_208_208" href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">208</a> Hence in Aeschylus we have something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
like that superb self-confidence which distinguishes a Parmenides
and a Heracleitus; in Sophocles that confession of
human ignorance which the Athenian philosophers made on
their own behalf, or strove to extract from others. Euripides
introduces us to another mode of thought, more akin to that
which characterises Aristotle. For, although there is abundance
of mystery in his tragedies, it has not the profound
religious significance of the Sophoclean irony; he uses it
rather for romantic and sentimental purposes, for the construction
of an intricate plot, or for the creation of pathetic
situations. His whole power is thrown into the immediate
and detailed representation of living passion, and of the surroundings
in which it is displayed, without going far back
into its historical antecedents like Aeschylus, or, like
Sophocles, into the divine purposes which underlie it. On
the other hand, as a Greek writer could not be other than
philosophical, he uses particular incidents as an occasion for
wide generalisations and dialectical discussions; these, and
not the idea of justice or of destiny, being the pedestal on
which his figures are set. And it may be noticed as another
curious coincidence that, like Aristotle again, he is disposed
to criticise his predecessors, or at least one of them, Aeschylus,
with some degree of asperity.</p>

<p>The critical tendency just alluded to suggests one more
reason why philosophy, from having been a method of discovery,
should at last become a mere method of description
and arrangement. The materials accumulated by nearly
three centuries of observation and reasoning were so enormous
that they began to stifle the imaginative faculty. If there
was any opening for originality it lay in the task of carrying
order into this chaos by reducing it to a few general heads,
by mapping out the whole field of knowledge, and subjecting
each particular branch to the new-found processes of definition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
and classification. And along with the incapacity for framing
new theories there arose a desire to diminish the number of
those already existing, to frame, if possible, a system which
should select and combine whatever was good in any or all
of them.</p>


<h3><a id="VI-VII"></a>VII.</h3>

<p>This, then, was the revolution effected by Aristotle, that
he found Greek thought in the form of a solid, and unrolled
into a surface of the utmost possible tenuity, transparency,
and extension. In so doing, he completed what Socrates and
Plato had begun, he paralleled the course already described
by Greek poetry, and he offered the first example of what
since then has more than once recurred in the history of
philosophy. It was thus that the residual substance of Locke
and Berkeley was resolved into phenomenal succession by
Hume. It was thus that the unexplained reality of Kant and
Fichte was drawn out into a play of logical relations by
Hegel. And, if we may venture on a forecast of the future
towards which speculation is now advancing, it is thus that
the limits imposed on human knowledge by positivists and
agnostics in our own day, are yielding to the criticism of those
who wish to establish either a perfect identity or a perfect
equation between consciousness and being. This is the position
represented in France by M. Taine, a thinker offering
many points of resemblance to Aristotle, which it would be
interesting to work out had we space at our command for the
purpose. The forces which are now guiding English philosophy
in an analogous direction have hitherto escaped
observation on account of their disunion among themselves,
and their intermixture with others of a different character.
But on the whole we may say that the philosophy of Mill and
his school corresponds very nearly in its practical idealism
to Plato’s teaching; that Mr. Herbert Spencer approaches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
Aristotle on the side of theorising systematisation, while
sharing to a more limited extent the metaphysical and
political realism which accompanied it: that Lewes was
carrying the same transformation a step further in his unfinished
<cite>Problems of Life and Mind</cite>; that the philosophy of
Mr. Shadworth Hodgson is marked by the same spirit of
actuality, though not without a vista of multitudinous possibilities
in the background; that the Neo-Hegelian school
are trying to do over again for us what their master did in
Germany; and that the lamented Professor Clifford had
already given promise of one more great attempt to widen the
area of our possible experience into co-extension with the
whole domain of Nature.<a id="FNanchor_209_209" href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">209</a></p>

<p>The systematising power of Aristotle, his faculty for bringing
the isolated parts of a surface into co-ordination and continuity,
is apparent even in those sciences with whose material
truths he was utterly unacquainted. Apart from the falseness
of their fundamental assumptions, his scientific treatises are,
for their time, masterpieces of method. In this respect they
far surpass his moral and metaphysical works, and they are
also written in a much more vigorous style, occasionally even
rising into eloquence. He evidently moves with much more
assurance on the solid ground of external nature than in the
cloudland of Platonic dialectics, or among the possibilities of
an ideal morality. If, for example, we open his <cite>Physics</cite>, we
shall find such notions as Causation, Infinity, Matter, Space,
Time, Motion, and Force, for the first time in history
separately discussed, defined, and made the foundation of
natural philosophy. The treatise <cite>On the Heavens</cite> very properly
regards the celestial movements as a purely mechanical
problem, and strives throughout to bring theory and practice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
into complete agreement. While directly contradicting the
truths of modern astronomy, it stands on the same ground
with them; and anyone who had mastered it would be far
better prepared to receive those truths than if he were only
acquainted with such a work as Plato’s <cite>Timaeus</cite>. The remaining
portions of Aristotle’s scientific encyclopaedia follow
in perfect logical order, and correspond very nearly to
Auguste Comte’s classification, if, indeed, they did not
directly or indirectly suggest it. We cannot, however, view
the labours of Aristotle with unmixed satisfaction until he
comes on to deal with the provinces of natural history, comparative
anatomy, and comparative psychology. Here, as
we have shown, the subject exactly suited the comprehensive
observation and systematising formalism in which he excelled.
Here, accordingly, not only the method but the matter of
his teaching is good. In theorising about the causes of
phenomena he was behind the best science of his age; in
dissecting the phenomena themselves he was far before it.
Of course very much of what he tells was learned at second-hand,
and some of it is not authentic. But to collect such
masses of information from the reports of uneducated hunters,
fishermen, grooms, shepherds, beemasters, and the like,
required an extraordinary power of putting pertinent questions,
such as could only be acquired in the school of Socratic
dialectic. Nor should we omit to notice the vivid intelligence
which enabled even ordinary Greeks to supply him
with the facts required for his generalisations. But some of
his most important researches must be entirely original. For
instance, he must have traced the development of the embryo
chicken with his own eyes; and, here, we have it on good
authority that his observations are remarkable for their
accuracy, in a field where accuracy, according to Caspar
Friedrich Wolff, is almost impossible.<a id="FNanchor_210_210" href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">210</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span></p>

<p>Still more important than these observations themselves
is the great truth he derives from them—since rediscovered
and worked out in detail by Von Baer—that in the development
of each individual the generic characters make their
appearance before the specific characters.<a id="FNanchor_211_211" href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> Nor is this a
mere accidental or isolated remark, but, as we shall show in
the next chapter, intimately connected with one of the
philosopher’s metaphysical theories. Although not an evolutionist,
he has made other contributions to biology, the importance
of which has been first realised in the light of the
evolution theory. Thus he notices the antagonism between
individuation and reproduction;<a id="FNanchor_212_212" href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> the connexion of increased
size with increased vitality;<a id="FNanchor_213_213" href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">213</a> the connexion of greater
mobility,<a id="FNanchor_214_214" href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> and of greater intelligence,<a id="FNanchor_215_215" href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">215</a> with increased complexity
of structure; the physiological division of labour in
the higher animals;<a id="FNanchor_216_216" href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> the formation of heterogeneous organs
out of homogeneous tissues;<a id="FNanchor_217_217" href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> the tendency towards greater
centralisation in the higher organisms<a id="FNanchor_218_218" href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">218</a>—a remark connected
with his two great anatomical discoveries, the central position
of the heart in the vascular system, and the possession of a
backbone by all red-blooded animals;<a id="FNanchor_219_219" href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">219</a> the resemblance of
animal intelligence to a rudimentary human intelligence,
especially as manifested in children;<a id="FNanchor_220_220" href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">220</a> and, finally, he
attempts to trace a continuous series of gradations connecting
the inorganic with the organic world, plants with animals,
and the lower animals with man.<a id="FNanchor_221_221" href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">221</a></p>

<p>The last mentioned principle gives one more illustration of
the distinction between Aristotle’s system and that of the
evolutionist, properly so called. The continuity recognised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
by the former only obtains among a number of coexisting
types; it is a purely logical or ideal arrangement, facilitating
the acquisition and retention of knowledge, but adding
nothing to its real content. The continuity of the latter
implies a causal connexion between successive types evolved
from each other by the action of mechanical forces. Moreover,
our modern theory, while accounting for whatever is
true in Aristotle’s conception, serves, at the same time, to
correct its exaggeration. The totality of existing species
only imperfectly fill up the interval between the highest
human life and the inorganic matter from which we assume
it to be derived, because they are collaterally, and not
lineally, related. Probably no one of them corresponds to
any less developed stage of another, although some have preserved,
with more constancy than others, the features of a
common parent. In diverging from a single stock (if we
accept the monogenetic hypothesis,) they have become
separated by considerable spaces, which the innumerable
multitude of extinct species alone could fill up.</p>

<p>Our preliminary survey of the subject is now completed.
So far, we have been engaged in studying the mind of
Aristotle rather than his system of philosophy. In the next
chapter we shall attempt to give a more complete account of
that system in its internal organisation not less than in its
relations to modern science and modern thought.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a><br />

<small>THE SYSTEMATIC PHILOSOPHY OF ARISTOTLE.</small></h2>


<h3><a id="VII-I"></a>I.</h3>

<p>We have considered the Aristotelian philosophy in relation
to the great concrete interests of life, morals, politics, literature,
and science. We have now to ask what it has to tell us
about the deepest and gravest problems of any, the first principles
of Being and Knowing, God and the soul, spirit and
matter, metaphysics, psychology, and logic. We saw that
very high claims were advanced on behalf of Aristotle in
respect to his treatment of these topics; and had we begun
with them, we should only have been following the usual
example of his expositors. We have, however, preferred
keeping them to the last, that our readers might acquire some
familiarity with the Aristotelian method, by seeing it applied
to subjects where the results were immediately intelligible,
and could be tested by an appeal to the experience of twenty-two
centuries. We know that there are some who will demur
to this proceeding, who will say that Aristotle the metaphysician
stands on quite different ground from Aristotle the
man of science, because in the one capacity he had, and in
the other capacity he had not, sufficient facts to warrant
an authoritative conclusion. They will say, with Prof. St.
George Mivart, that in accumulating natural knowledge men’s
minds have become deadened to spiritual truth; or with Mr.
Edwin Wallace, that the questions opened by Aristotle have
not yet been closed, and that we may with advantage begin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
our study of them under his guidance. We, on the other
hand, will endeavour to show that there is a unity of composition
running through the Stagirite’s entire labours, that they
everywhere manifest the same excellences and defects, which
are those of an anatomising, critical, descriptive, classificatory
genius; that his most important conclusions, however great
their historical interest, are without any positive or even
educational value for us, being almost entirely based on false
physical assumptions; that his ontology and psychology are
not what his admirers suppose them to be; and that his
logic, though meriting our gratitude, is far too confused and
incomplete to throw any light on the questions raised by
modern thinkers.</p>

<p>Here, as elsewhere, we shall employ the genetic method
of investigation. Aristotle’s writings do not, indeed, present
that gradual development of ideas which makes the Platonic
Dialogues so interesting. Still they exhibit traces of such a
development, and the most important among them seems to
have been compiled from notes taken by the philosopher
before his conclusions were definitely reasoned out, or worked
up into a consistent whole. It is this fragmentary collection
which, from having been placed by some unknown editor
after the <cite>Physics</cite>, has received a name still associated with
every kind of speculation that cannot be tested by a direct or
indirect appeal to the evidence of external sense.</p>

<p>Whether there exist any realities beyond what are revealed
to us by this evidence, and what sensible evidence itself may
be worth, were problems already actively canvassed in
Aristotle’s time. His <cite>Metaphysics</cite> at once takes us into the
thick of the debate. The first question of that age was, What
are the causes and principles of things? On one side stood
the materialists—the old Ionian physicists and their living
representatives. They said that all things came from water
or air or fire, or from a mixture of the four elements, or from
the interaction of opposites, such as wet and dry, hot and cold.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
Aristotle, following in the track of his master, Plato, blames
them for ignoring the incorporeal substances, by which he
does not mean what would now be understood—feelings or
states of consciousness, or even the spiritual substratum of
consciousness—but rather the general qualities or assemblages
of qualities which remain constant amid the fluctuations of
sensible phenomena; considered, let us observe, not as subjective
thoughts, but as objective realities. Another deficiency
in the older physical theories is that they either ignore the
efficient cause of motion altogether (like Thales), or assign
causes not adequate to the purpose (like Empedocles); or
when they hit on the true cause do not make the right use of
it (like Anaxagoras). Lastly, they have omitted to study
the final cause of a thing—the good for which it exists.</p>

<p>The teleology of Aristotle requires a word of explanation,
which may appropriately find its place in the present connexion.
In speaking of a purpose in Nature, he does not mean
that natural productions subserve an end lying outside themselves;
as if, to use Goethe’s illustration, the bark of cork-trees
was intended to be made into stoppers for ginger-beer
bottles; but that in every perfect thing the parts are interdependent,
and exist for the sake of the whole to which they
belong. Nor does he, like so many theologians, both ancient
and modern, argue from the evidence of design in Nature to
the operation of a designing intelligence outside her. Not
believing in any creation at all apart from works of art, he
could not believe in a creative intelligence other than that of
man. He does, indeed, constantly speak of Nature as if she
were a personal providence, continually exerting herself for
the good of her creatures. But, on looking a little closer,
we find that the agency in question is completely unconscious,
and may be identified with the constitution of each particular
thing, or rather of the type to which it belongs. We have
said that Aristotle’s intellect was essentially descriptive, and
we have here another illustration of its characteristic quality.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
The teleology which he parades with so much pomp adds
nothing to our knowledge of causes, implies nothing that a
positivist need not readily accept. It is a mere study of
functions, an analysis of statical relations. Of course, if there
were really any philosophers who said that the connexion
between teeth and mastication was entirely accidental, the
Aristotelian doctrine was a useful protest against such an
absurdity; but when we have established a fixed connexion
between organ and function, we are bound to explain the
association in some more satisfactory manner than by reaffirming
it in general terms, which is all that Aristotle ever
does. Again, whatever may be the relative justification of
teleology as a study of functions in the living body, we have
no grounds for interpreting the phenomena of inorganic
nature on an analogous principle. Some Greek philosophers
were acute enough to perceive the distinction. While admitting
that plants and animals showed traces of design, they
held that the heavenly bodies arose spontaneously from the
movements of a vortex or some such cause;<a id="FNanchor_222_222" href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">222</a> just as certain
religious savants of our own day reject the Darwinian theory
while accepting the nebular hypothesis.<a id="FNanchor_223_223" href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">223</a> But to Aristotle the
unbroken regularity of the celestial movements, which to us
is the best proof of their purely mechanical nature, was, on
the contrary, a proof that they were produced and directed
by an absolutely reasonable purpose; much more so indeed
than terrestrial organisms, marked as these are by occasional
deviations and imperfections; and he concludes that each of
those movements must be directed towards the attainment of
some correspondingly consummate end;<a id="FNanchor_224_224" href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">224</a> while, again, in
dealing with those precursors of Mr. Darwin, if such they can
be called, who argued that the utility of an organ does not
disprove its spontaneous origin, since only the creatures which,
by a happy accident, came to possess it would survive—he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
answers that the constant reproduction of such organs is
enough to vindicate them from being the work of chance;<a id="FNanchor_225_225" href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">225</a>
thus displaying his inability to distinguish between the two
ideas of uniform causation and design.</p>

<p>As a result of the foregoing criticism, Aristotle distinguishes
four different causes or principles by which all things
are determined to be what they are—Matter, Form, Agent,
and Purpose.<a id="FNanchor_226_226" href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">226</a> If, for example, we take a saw, the matter is
steel; the form, a toothed blade; the agent or cause of its
assuming that shape, a smith; the purpose, to divide wood
or stone. When we have enumerated these four principles,
we have told everything that can be known about a saw. But
Aristotle could not keep the last three separate; he gradually
extended the definition of form until it absorbed, or became
identified with, agent and purpose.<a id="FNanchor_227_227" href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">227</a> It was what we should
call the idea of function that facilitated the transition. If the
very essence or nature of a saw implies use, activity, movement,
how can we define it without telling its purpose? The
toothed blade is only intelligible as a cutting, dividing instrument.
Again, how came the saw into being? What shaped
the steel into that particular form? We have said that it
was the smith. But surely that is too vague. The smith is
a man, and may be able to exercise other trades as well.
Suppose him to be a musician, did he make the saw in that
capacity? No; and here comes in a distinction which plays
an immense part in Aristotle’s metaphysics, whence it has
passed into our every-day speech. He does not make the
saw <i lang="la">quâ</i> musician but <i lang="la">quâ</i> smith. He can, however, in the
exercise of his trade as smith make many other tools—knives,
axes, and so forth. Nevertheless, had he only learned to
make saws it would be enough. Therefore, he does not make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
the saw <i lang="la">quâ</i> axe-maker, he makes it <i lang="la">quâ</i> saw-maker. Nor,
again, does he make it with his whole mind and body, but
only with just those thoughts and movements required to give
the steel that particular shape. Now, what are these thoughts
but the idea of a saw present in his mind and passing through
his eyes and hands, till it fixes itself on the steel? The
immaterial form of a saw creates the real saw which we use.
Let us apply the preceding analogies to a natural object; for
example, a man. What is the Form, the definition of a man?
Not a being possessing a certain outward shape, for then a
marble statue would be a man, which it is not; nor yet
a certain assemblage of organs, for then a corpse would be a
man, which, according to Aristotle, criticising Democritus, it
is not; but a living, feeling, and reasoning being, the end of
whose existence is to fulfil all the functions involved in this
definition. So, also, the creative cause of a man is another
man, who directly impresses the human form on the material
supplied by the female organism. In the same way, every
definite individual aggregate becomes what it is through the
agency of another individual representing the same type in
its perfect manifestation.<a id="FNanchor_228_228" href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">228</a></p>

<p>The substantial forms of Aristotle, combining as they do
the notion of a definition with that of a moving cause and a
fulfilled purpose, are evidently derived from the Platonic
Ideas; a reflection which at once leads us to consider the
relation in which he stands to the spiritualism of Plato and
to the mathematical idealism of the Neo-Pythagoreans. He
agrees with them in thinking that general conceptions are the
sole object of knowledge—the sole enduring reality in a world
of change. He differs from them in maintaining that such
conceptions have no existence apart from the particulars in
which they reside. It has been questioned whether Aristotle
ever really understood his master’s teaching on the subject.
Among recent critics, M. Barthélemy Saint-Hilaire asserts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
with considerable vehemence, that he did not. It is certain
that in some respects Aristotle is not just to the Platonic
theory, that he exaggerates its absurdities, ignores its developments,
and occasionally brings charges against it which might
be retorted with at least equal effect against his own philosophy.
But on the most important point of all, whether
Plato did or did not ascribe a separate existence to his Ideas,
we could hardly believe a disciple of twenty years’ standing<a id="FNanchor_229_229" href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">229</a>
to be mistaken, even if the master had not left on record a
decisive testimony to the affirmative side in his <cite>Parmenides</cite>,
and one scarcely less decisive in his <cite>Timaeus</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_230_230" href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">230</a> And so far as
the controversy reduces itself to this particular issue, Aristotle
is entirely right. His most powerful arguments are not,
indeed, original, having been anticipated by Plato himself;
but as they were left unanswered he had a perfect right to
repeat them, and his dialectical skill was great enough to
make him independent of their support. The extreme
minuteness of his criticism is wearisome to us, who can hardly
conceive how another opinion could ever have been held.
Yet such was the fascination exercised by Plato’s idealism,
that not only was it upheld with considerable acrimony by
his immediate followers,<a id="FNanchor_231_231" href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">231</a> but under one form or another it
has been revived over and over again, in the long period
which has elapsed since its first promulgation, and on every
one of these occasions the arguments of Aristotle have been
raised up again to meet it, each time with triumphant success.
Ockham’s razor, <i lang="la">Entia non sunt sine necessitate multiplicanda</i>,
is borrowed from the <cite>Metaphysics</cite>; Locke’s principal objection
to innate ideas closely resembles the sarcastic observation in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
the last chapter of the <cite>Posterior Analytics</cite>, that, according to
Plato’s theory, we must have some very wonderful knowledge
of which we are not conscious.<a id="FNanchor_232_232" href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> And the weapons with which
Trendelenburg and others have waged war on Hegel are
avowedly drawn from the Aristotelian arsenal.<a id="FNanchor_233_233" href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">233</a></p>

<p>In his criticism on the ideal theory, Aristotle argues that
it is unproved; that the consequences to which it leads
would be rejected by the idealists themselves; that it involves
a needless addition to the sum of existence; that it neither
explains the origin of things nor helps us to understand them,
while taking away from them their substantial reality; that
the Ideas are merely sensible objects hypostasised, like the
anthropomorphic divinities of primitive men; that, to speak
of them as patterns, in whose likeness the world was created,
is a mere idle metaphor; that, even assuming the existence
of such patterns, each individual must be made in the likeness,
not of one, but of many ideas—a human being, for
instance, must be modelled after the ideal biped and the
ideal animal, as well as after the ideal man; while many of
the ideas themselves, although all are supposed to exist
absolutely, must be dependent on other and simpler types;
finally, that, assuming an idea for every abstract relation,
there must be ideas to represent the relation between every
sensible object and its prototype, others for the new relations
thus introduced, and so on to infinity.</p>

<p>Aristotle’s objections to the Neo-Pythagorean theory of
ideal numbers need not delay us here. They are partly a
repetition of those brought against the Platonic doctrine in its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
original form, partly derived from the impossibility of identifying
qualitative with quantitative differences.<a id="FNanchor_234_234" href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">234</a></p>

<p>Such arguments manifestly tell not only against Platonism,
but against every kind of transcendental realism, from the
natural theology of Paley to the dogmatic agnosticism of
Mr. Herbert Spencer. A modern Aristotle might say that
the hypothesis of a creative first cause, personal or otherwise,
logically involves the assumption of as many original specific
energies as there are qualities to be accounted for, and thus
gives us the unnecessary trouble of counting everything twice
over; that every difficulty and contradiction from which the
transcendental assumption is intended to free us, must, on
analysis, reappear in the assumption itself—for example, the
God who is to deliver us from evil must be himself conceived
as the creator of evil; that the infinite and absolute can
neither cause, nor be apprehended by, the finite and relative;
that to separate from Nature all the forces required for its
perpetuation, and relegate them to a sphere apart, is a false
antithesis and a sterile abstraction; lastly, that causation,
whether efficient or final, once begun, cannot stop; that if
this world is not self-existing, nothing is; that the mutual
adaptation of thoughts in a designing intelligence requires to
be accounted for just like any other adaptation; that if the
relative involves the absolute, so also does the relation between
the two involve another absolute, and so on to infinity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These are difficulties which will continue to perplex us
until every shred of the old metaphysics has been thrown off.
To that task Aristotle was not equal. He was profoundly
influenced by the very theory against which he contended;
and, at the risk of being paradoxical, we may even say that it
assumed a greater importance in his system than had ever
been attributed to it by Plato himself. To prove this, we
must resume the thread of our exposition, and follow the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
Stagirite still further in his analysis of the fundamental
reality with which the highest philosophy is concerned.</p>


<h3><a id="VII-II"></a>II.</h3>

<p>Ever since the age of Parmenides and Heracleitus, Greek
thought had been haunted by a pervading dualism which
each system had in turn attempted to reconcile, with no
better result than its reproduction under altered names.
And speculation had latterly become still further perplexed
by the question whether the antithetical couples supposed to
divide all Nature between them could or could not be reduced
to so many aspects of a single opposition. In the last
chapter but one we showed that there were four such competing
pairs—Being and Not-Being, the One and the Many,
the Same and the Other, Rest and Motion. Plato employed
his very subtlest dialectic in tracing out their connexions,
readjusting their relationships, and diminishing the total
number of terms which they involved. In what was probably
his last great speculative effort, the <cite>Timaeus</cite>, he seems to
have selected Sameness and Difference as the couple best
adapted to bear the heaviest strain of thought. There is
some reason for believing that in his spoken lectures he
followed the Pythagorean system more closely, giving the
preference to the One and the Many; or he may have
employed the two expressions indifferently. The former
would sooner commend itself to a dialectician, the latter to a
mathematician. Aristotle was both, but he was before all
things a naturalist. As such, the antithesis of Being and
Not-Being, to which Plato attached little or no value, suited
him best. Accordingly, he proceeds to work it out with a
clearness before unknown in Greek philosophy. The first
and surest of all principles, he declares, is, that a thing cannot
both be and not be, in the same sense of the words, and
furthermore that it must either be or not be. Subsequent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
logicians prefixed to these axioms another, declaring that
whatever is is. The three together are known as the laws of
Identity, Contradiction, and Excluded Middle. By all, except
Hegelians, they are recognised as the highest laws of thought;
and even Hegel was indebted to them, through Fichte, for the
ground-plan of his entire system.<a id="FNanchor_235_235" href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">235</a></p>

<p>The whole meaning and value of such excessively abstract
propositions must lie in their application to the problems
which they are employed to solve. Aristotle made at once
too much and too little of his. Too much—for he employed
them to refute doctrines not really involving any logical inconsistency—the
theory of Heracleitus, that everything is in
motion; the theory of Anaxagoras, that everything was
originally confused together; the theory of Protagoras, that
man is the measure of all things. Too little—for he admitted
a sphere of possibilities where logical definition did not
apply, and where subjects simultaneously possessed the
capacity of taking on one or other of two contradictory
attributes.</p>

<p>Nor is this all. After sharply distinguishing what is
from what is not, and refusing to admit any intermediary
between them, Aristotle proceeds to discover such an intermediary
in the shape of what he calls Accidental Predication.<a id="FNanchor_236_236" href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">236</a>
An accident is an attribute not necessarily or usually inhering
in its subject—in other words, a co-existence not dependent
on causation. Aristotle could never distinguish between the
two notions of cause and kind, nor yet between interferences
with the action of some particular cause and exceptions to
the law of causation in general; and so he could not frame
an intelligible theory of chance. Some propositions, he tells
us, are necessarily true, others are only generally true; and
it is the exceptions to the latter which constitute accident; as,
for instance, when a cold day happens to come in the middle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
of summer. So also a man is necessarily an animal, but
only exceptionally white. Such distinctions are not uninteresting,
for they prove with what difficulties the idea of
invariable sequence had to contend before even the highest
intellects could grasp it. There was a constant liability to
confound the order of succession with the order of co-existence,
the order of our sensations with the order of objective
existence, and the subjection of human actions to any fixed
order, with the impossibility of deliberation and choice. The
earlier Greek thinkers had proclaimed that all things existed
by necessity; but with their purely geometrical or historical
point of view, they entirely ignored the more complex questions
raised by theories about classification, logical attribution,
and moral responsibility. And the modifications introduced
by Epicurus, into the old physics, show us how unanswerable
Aristotle’s reasonings seemed to some of his ablest
successors.</p>

<p>Absolute being is next distinguished from truth, which,
we are told, has no objective existence<a id="FNanchor_237_237" href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">237</a>—a remarkable
declaration, which throws much light on other parts of the
Aristotelian system, and to which we shall subsequently
return.<a id="FNanchor_238_238" href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">238</a></p>

<p>After explaining at considerable length what Being is not,
Aristotle now proceeds to ascertain what it is. He tells us
that just as all number <i lang="la">quâ</i> number must be either odd or
even, so all Being <i lang="la">quâ</i> Being must have certain universal
attributes. These he sets himself to discover. When
Descartes long afterwards entered on a somewhat similar
inquiry, he fell back on the facts of his own individual consciousness.
Aristotle, on the contrary, appeals to the common
consciousness of mankind as embodied in ordinary language.
In how many senses do we say that a thing is? The first
answer is contained in his famous Ten Categories.<a id="FNanchor_239_239" href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">239</a> These<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
are not what some have supposed them to be, <i lang="la">summa genera</i>
of existence, but <i lang="la">summa genera</i> of predication. In other
words, they are not a classification of things, but of the information
which it is possible to receive about a single
thing, more especially about the richest and most concrete
thing known to us—a human being. If we want to find out
all about a thing we ask, What is it? Of what sort? How
large? To what does it belong? Where and when can we
find it? What does it do? What happens to it? And if
the object of our investigations be a living thing, we may
add, What are its habits and dispositions? The question
has been raised, how Aristotle came to think of these ten
particular categories, and a wonderful amount of rubbish has
been written on the subject, while apparently no scholar
could see what was staring him in the face all the time,
that Aristotle got them by collecting all the simple forms
of interrogation supplied by the Greek language,<a id="FNanchor_240_240" href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">240</a> and writing
out their most general expressions.</p>

<p>Having obtained his categories, Aristotle proceeds to
mark off the first from the other nine. The subject or
substance named in answer to the question, What is it? can
exist without having any quality, size, and so forth predicated
of it; but they cannot exist without it. Logically, they
cannot be defined without telling <em>what</em> they are; really they
cannot be conceived without something not themselves in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
which they inhere. They are like the tail of a kite, giving
greater conspicuousness and buoyancy to the body, but
entirely dependent on it for support. What our philosopher
fails to perceive is, that the dependence is reciprocal, that
substance can no more be conceived without attributes than
attributes without substance; or rather that substance, like
all other categories, can be resolved into Relation.<a id="FNanchor_241_241" href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">241</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, he had a logical machine ready to hand,
which could be used with terrible effect against the Platonic
Ideas. Any of these—and there were a great number—that
could be brought under one of the last nine categories were
at once deprived of all claim to independent existence.
Take Equality, for instance. It cannot be discovered outside
quantity, and quantity is always predicated of a substance.
And the same is true of number, to the utter destruction of
the Neo-Pythagorean theory which gave it a separate existence.
Moreover, the categories served not only to generalise
and combine, but also to specificate and divide. The idea of
motion occurs in three of them; in quantity, where it means
increase or diminution; in quality, where it means alteration,
as from hot to cold, or <i lang="la">vice versâ</i>; and in place, implying
transport from one point to another. The Idea of Good,
which stands at the very summit of Plato’s system, may be
traced through all ten categories.<a id="FNanchor_242_242" href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">242</a> Thus, the supposed unity
and simplicity of such conceptions was shown to be an
illusion. Platonism was, in truth, so inconsistent with the
notions embodied in common language, that it could not but
be condemned by a logic based on those notions.</p>

<p>Aristotle next takes the Idea of Substance and subjects it
to a fresh analysis.<a id="FNanchor_243_243" href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> Of all things none seem to possess so
evident an existence as the bodies about us—plants and
animals, the four elements, and the stars. But each of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
has already been shown to consist of Form and Matter. A
statue, for instance, is a lump of bronze shaped into the
figure of a man. Of these two constituents, Matter seems at
first sight to possess the greater reality. The same line of
thought which led Aristotle to place substance before the
other categories now threatens to drive him back into
materialism. This he dreaded, not on sentimental or
religious grounds, but because he conceived it to be the
negation of knowledge. He first shows that Matter cannot
be the real substance to which individuals owe their determinate
existence, since it is merely the unknown residuum
left behind when every predicate, common to them with
others, has been stripped off. Substance, then, must be
either Form alone or Form combined with Matter. Form,
in its completest sense, is equivalent to the essential definition
of a thing—the collection of attributes together constituting
its essence or conception. To know the definition is to know
the thing defined. The way to define is to begin with the
most general notion, and proceed by adding one specific
difference after another, until we reach the most particular
and concrete expression. The union of this last with a
certain portion of Matter gives us the individual Socrates or
Callias. There are no real entities (as the Platonists pretend)
corresponding to the successive stages of generalisation,
biped, animal, and so forth, any more than there are self-existing
quantities, qualities, and relations. Thus the problem
has been driven into narrower and narrower limits, until at
last we are left with the <i lang="la">infimæ species</i> and the individuals
contained under them. It remains to discover in what
relation these stand to one another. The answer is unsatisfactory.
We are told that there is no definition of individuals,
and also that the definition is identical with the individual.<a id="FNanchor_244_244" href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">244</a>
Such, indeed, is the conclusion necessarily resulting from
Aristotle’s repeated declarations that all knowledge is of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
definitions, that all knowledge is of something really existing,
and that nothing really exists but individual things. Nevertheless,
against these we have to set equally strong declarations
to the effect that knowledge is of something general,
not of the perishing individuals which may pass out of
existence at any moment. The truth is, that we are here, as
Zeller has shown,<a id="FNanchor_245_245" href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">245</a> in presence of an insoluble contradiction,
and we must try to explain, not how Aristotle reconciled
it with itself, for that was impossible, but how he reconciled
himself to it.</p>

<p>His analysis of individuality was the first step in this
direction. We have seen that he treats definition as a
process of gradual specification, beginning with the most
general notions, and working down by successive differentiations
to the most particular. Now, the completed conception is
itself the integration of all these differences, the bond of union
holding them together. Turning to an antithetical order of
ideas, to the material substance of which bodies are composed,
and its various transformations, we find him working out
the same vein of thought. According to the Aristotelian
chemistry, an ultimate indeterminate unknowable something
clothes itself with one or other of the opposing attributes, dry
and moist, hot and cold; and when two of these are combined,
manifests itself to our senses as one of the four elements.
The elements combine in a particular manner to form
homogeneous animal tissues, and these again are united into
heterogeneous organs, which together constitute the living
body. Here, then, we have two analogous series of specifications—one
conceptual and leading down from the abstract to
the concrete, the other physical, and leading up from the
vague, the simple, and the homogeneous, to the definite, the
complex, and the heterogeneous. Aristotle embraces both
processes under a single comprehensive generalisation. He
describes each of them as the continuous conversion of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
possibility into an actuality. For the sake of greater clearness,
let us take the liberty of substituting modern scientific
terms for his cumbrous and obsolete classifications. We
shall then say that the general notion, living thing, contains
under it the two less general notions—plant and animal. If we
only know of any given object that it has life, there is implied
the possibility of its being either the one or the other, but not
both together. On determining it to be (say) an animal, we
actualise one of the possibilities. But the actualisation is
only relative, and immediately becomes the possibility of
being either a vertebrate or an invertebrate animal. The
actuality vertebrate becomes the possibility of viviparous
or oviparous, and so on through successive differentiations
until we come (say) to a man. Now let us begin at the
material end. Here are a mass of molecules, which, in their
actual state are only carbon, nitrogen, and so forth. But
they are potential starch, gluten, water, or any other article
of food that might be named; for under favourable conditions
they will combine to form it. Once actualised as such, they
are possible blood-cells; these are possible tissues; these,
again, possible organs, and lastly we come to the consensus
of vital functions, which is a man. What the raw material is
to the finished product, that are the parts to the entire
organism, the elements to the compound, the genus to the
species, and such in its very widest sense is potency to
realisation, δύναμις to ἐντελέχεια, throughout the universe of
growth and decay.<a id="FNanchor_246_246" href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">246</a></p>

<p>It will be observed that, so far, this famous theory does
not add one single jot to our knowledge. Under the guise of
an explanation, it is a description of the very facts needing
to be explained. We did not want an Aristotle to tell us
that before a thing exists it must be possible. We want to
know how it is possible, what are the real conditions of its
existence, and why they combine at a particular moment to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
produce it. The Atomists showed in what direction the
solution should be sought, and all subsequent progress has
been due to a development of their method. Future ages
will perhaps consider our own continued distinction between
force and motion as a survival of the Peripatetic philosophy.
Just as sensible aggregates of matter arise not out of
potential matter, but out of matter in an extremely fine state
of diffusion, so also sensible motion will be universally traced
back, not to potential motion, which is all that force means,
but to molecular or ethereal vibrations, like those known to
constitute heat and light.</p>

<p>We have said, in comparing him with his predecessors,
that the Stagirite unrolled Greek thought from a solid into a
continuous surface. We have now to add that he gave his
surface the false appearance of a solid by the use of shadows,
and of aërial perspective. In other words, he made the
indication of his own ignorance and confusion do duty for
depth and distance. For to say that a thing is developed out
of its possibility, merely means that it is developed out of
something, the nature of which we do not know. And to
speak about such possibilities as imperfect existences, or
matter, or whatever else Aristotle may be pleased to call them,
is simply constructing the universe, not out of our ideas, but
out of our absolute want of ideas.</p>

<p>We have seen how, for the antithesis between Form and
Matter, was substituted the wider antithesis between Actuality
and Possibility. Even in this latter the opposition is more
apparent than real. A permanent possibility is only intelligible
through the idea of its realisation, and sooner or later is
certain to be realised. Aristotle still further bridges over the
interval between them by a new conception—that of motion.
Motion, he tells us, is the process of realisation, the transformation
of power into act. Nearly the whole of his <cite>Physics</cite> is
occupied with an enquiry into its nature and origin. As first
conceived, it is equivalent to what we call change rather than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
to mechanical movement. The table of categories supplies
an exhaustive enumeration of its varieties. These are, as we
have already mentioned, alteration of quality or transformation,
increase or decrease of quantity, equivalent to growth
and decay, and transport from place to place. Sometimes a
fourth variety is added, derived from the first category,
substance. He calls it generation and destruction, the coming
into existence or passing out of it again. A careful analysis
shows that motion in space is the primordial change on which
all others depend for their accomplishment. To account for
it is the most vitally important problem in philosophy.</p>


<h3><a id="VII-III"></a>III.</h3>

<p>Before entering on the chain of reasoning which led
Aristotle to postulate the existence of a personal First Cause,
we must explain the difference between his scientific standpoint,
and that which is now accepted by all educated minds.
To him the eternity not only of Matter, but also of what
he called Form,—that is to say, the collection of attributes
giving definiteness to natural aggregates, more especially
those known as organic species—was an axiomatic certainty.
Every type, capable of self-propagation, that could exist at
all, had existed, and would continue to exist for ever. For
this, no explanation beyond the generative power of Nature
was required. But when he had to account for the machinery
by which the perpetual alternation of birth and death below,
and the changeless revolutions of the celestial spheres above
the moon were preserved, difficulties arose. He had reduced
every other change to transport through space; and with
regard to this his conceptions were entirely mistaken. He
believed that moving matter tended to stop unless it was
sustained by some external force; and whatever their advantages
over him in other respects, we cannot say that the
Atomists were in a position to correct him here: for their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
theory, that every particle of matter gravitated downward
through infinite space, was quite incompatible with the latest
astronomical discoveries. Aristotle triumphantly showed that
the tendency of heavy bodies was not to move indefinitely
downwards in parallel lines, but to move in converging lines
to the centre of the earth, which he, in common with most
Greek astronomers, supposed to be also the centre of the
universe; and seeing light bodies move up, he credited them
with an equal and opposite tendency to the circumference of
the universe, which, like Parmenides and Plato, he believed to
be of finite extent. Thus each kind of matter has its appropriate
place, motion to which ends in rest, while motion away
from it, being constrained, cannot last. Accordingly, the
constant periodicity of terrestrial phenomena necessitates as
constant a transformation of dry and wet, and of hot and cold
bodies into one another. This is explained with perfect
accuracy by the diurnal and annual revolutions of the sun.
Here, however, we are introduced to a new kind of motion,
which, instead of being rectilinear and finite, is circular and
eternal. To account for it, Aristotle assumes a fifth element
entirely different in character from the four terrestrial elements.
Unlike them, it is absolutely simple, and has a correspondingly
simple mode of motion, which, as our philosopher erroneously
supposes, can be no other than circular rotation.</p>

<p>Out of this eternal unchanging divine substance, which he
calls aether, are formed the heavenly bodies and the transparent
spheres containing them. But there is something
beyond it of an even higher and purer nature. Aristotle
proves, with great subtlety, from his fundamental assumptions,
that the movement of an extended substance cannot be self-caused.
He also proves that motion must be absolutely continuous
and without a beginning. We have, therefore, no
choice but to accept the existence of an unextended, immaterial,
eternal, and infinite Power on which the whole
cosmos depends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span></p>

<p>So much only is established in the <cite>Physics</cite>. Further particulars
are given in the twelfth book of the <cite>Metaphysics</cite>.
There we learn that, all movement being from possibility to
actuality, the source of movement must be a completely
realised actuality—pure form without any admixture of matter.
But the highest form known to us in the ascending scale of
organic life is the human soul, and the highest function of
soul is reason. Reason then must be that which moves without
being moved itself, drawing all things upwards and
onwards by the love which its perfection inspires. The eternal,
infinite, absolute actuality existing beyond the outermost
starry sphere is God. Aristotle describes God as the thought
which thinks itself and finds in the simple act of self-consciousness
an everlasting happiness, wonderful if it always
equals the best moments of our mortal life, more wonderful
still if it surpasses them. There is only one supreme God, for
plurality is due to an admixture of matter, and He is pure
form. The rule of many is not good, as Homer says. Let
there be one Lord.</p>

<p>Such are the closing words of what was possibly Aristotle’s
last work, the clear confession of his monotheistic creed. A
monotheistic creed, we have said, but one so unlike all other
religions, that its nature has been continually misunderstood.
While some have found in it a theology like that of the Jews
or of Plato or of modern Europe, others have resolved it into
a vague pantheism. Among the latter we are surprised to
find Sir A. Grant, a writer to whom the Aristotelian texts
must be perfectly familiar both in spirit and in letter. Yet
nothing can possibly be more clear and emphatic than the
declarations they contain. Pantheism identifies God with the
world; Aristotle separates them as pure form from form more
or less alloyed with matter. Pantheism denies personality to
God; Aristotle gives him unity, spirituality, self-consciousness,
and happiness. If these qualities do not collectively involve
personality, we should like to know what does. Need we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
remind the accomplished editor of the <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite>
how great a place is given in that work to human self-consciousness,
to waking active thought as distinguished from
mere slumbering faculties or unrealised possibilities of action?
And what Aristotle regarded as essential to human perfection,
he would regard as still more essential to divine perfection.
Finally, the God of pantheism is a general idea; the God of
Aristotle is an individual. Sir A. Grant says that he (or it)
is the idea of Good.<a id="FNanchor_247_247" href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> We doubt very much whether there is
a single passage in the <cite>Metaphysics</cite> to sanction such an expression.
Did it occur, however, that would be no warrant for
approximating the Aristotelian to the Platonic theology, in
presence of such a distinct declaration as that the First Mover is
both conceptually and numerically one,<a id="FNanchor_248_248" href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> coming after repeated
repudiations of the Platonic attempt to isolate ideas from the
particulars in which they are immersed. Then Sir A. Grant
goes on to speak of the desire felt by Nature for God as being
itself God,<a id="FNanchor_249_249" href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">249</a> and therefore involving a belief in pantheism.
Such a notion is not generally called pantheism, but hylozoism,
the attribution of life to matter. We have no desire, however,
to quarrel about words. The philosopher who believes in the
existence of a vague consciousness, a spiritual effort towards
something higher diffused through nature, may, if you will, be
called a pantheist, but not unless this be the only divinity he
recognises. The term is altogether misleading when applied
to one who also proclaims the existence of something in his
opinion far higher, better and more real—a living God, who
transcends Nature, and is independent of her, although she is
not independent of him.</p>

<p>We must also observe that the parallel drawn by Sir A.
Grant between the theology of Aristotle and that of John
Stuart Mill is singularly unfortunate. It is in the first place
incorrect to say that Mill represented God as benevolent but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
not omnipotent. He only suggested the idea as less inconsistent
with facts than other forms of theism.<a id="FNanchor_250_250" href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">250</a> In the next
place, Aristotle’s God was almost exactly the reverse of this.
He possesses infinite power, but no benevolence at all. He
has nothing to do with the internal arrangements of the world,
either as creator or as providence. He is, in fact, an egoist
of the most transcendent kind, who does nothing but think
about himself and his own perfections. Nothing could be
more characteristic of the unpractical Aristotelian philosophy;
nothing more repugnant to the eager English reformer, the
pupil of Bentham and of Plato. And, thirdly, Sir A. Grant
takes what is not the God of Aristotle’s system at all, but a
mere abstraction, the immanent reason of Nature, the Form
which can never quite conquer Matter, and places it on the
same line with a God who, however hypothetical, is nothing
if not a person distinct from the world; while, as if to bewilder
the unfortunate ‘English reader’ still further, he adds, in the
very next sentence, that ‘the great defect in Aristotle’s conception
of God is’ the denial ‘that God can be a moral
Being.’<a id="FNanchor_251_251" href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">251</a></p>

<p>The words last quoted, which in a Christian sense are true
enough, lead us over to the contrasting view of Aristotle’s
theology, to the false theory of it held by critics like Prof. St.
George Mivart. The Stagirite agrees with Catholic theism in
accepting a personal God, and he agrees with the First Article
of the English Church, though not with the Pentateuch, in
saying that God is without parts or passions; but there his
agreement ceases. Excluding such a thing as divine interference
with nature, his theology of course excludes the possibility
of revelation, inspiration, miracles, and grace. Nor is this a
mere omission; it is a necessity of the system. If there can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
be no existence without time, no time without motion, no
motion without unrealised desire, no desire without an ideal,
no ideal but eternally self-thinking thought—then it logically
follows that God, in the sense of such a thought, must not
interest himself in the affairs of men. Again, Aristotelianism
equally excludes the arguments by which modern theologians
have sought to prove the existence of God. Here also the
system is true to its contemporaneous, statical, superficial character.
The First Mover is not separated from us by a chain
of causes extending through past ages, but by an intervening
breadth of space and the wheels within wheels of a cosmic
machine. Aristotle had no difficulty in conceiving what some
have since declared to be inconceivable, a series of antecedents
without any beginning in time; it was rather the beginning of
such a series that he could not make intelligible to himself.
Nor, as we have seen, did he think that the adaptation in
living organisms of each part to every other required an
external explanation. Far less did it occur to him that the
production of impressions on our senses was due to the
agency of a supernatural power. It is absolutely certain that
he would have rejected the Cartesian argument, according to
which a perfect being must exist if it be only conceivable—existence
being necessarily involved in the idea of perfection.<a id="FNanchor_252_252" href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">252</a>
Finally, not recognising such a faculty as conscience, he
would not have admitted it to be the voice of God speaking
in the soul.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Aristotle’s own theistic arguments
cannot stand for a moment in the face of modern science.
We know by the law of inertia that it is not the continuance,
but the arrest or the beginning of motion which requires to
be accounted for. We know by the Copernican system that
there is no solid sidereal sphere governing the revolutions of
all Nature. And we know by the Newtonian physics that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
gravitation is not dependent on fixed points in space for its
operation. <em>The</em> Philosophy of <em>the</em> Philosopher Aristotle is as
inconsistent with the demonstrations of modern astronomy as
it is with the faith of mediaeval Catholicism.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether the system which we are
examining is consistent with itself. It is not. The Prime
Mover, being unextended, cannot be located outside the sidereal
sphere; nor can he be brought into immediate contact
with it more than with any other part of the cosmos. If the
aether has a motion proper to itself, then no spiritual agency
is required to keep it in perpetual rotation. If the crystalline
spheres fit accurately together, as they must, to avoid leaving
a vacuum anywhere, there can be no friction, no production
of heat, and consequently no effect produced on the sublunary
sphere. Finally, no rotatory or other movement can, taken
alone, have any conceivable connexion with the realisation
of a possibility, in the sense of progress from a lower to
a higher state of being. It is merely the perpetual exchange
of one indifferent position for another.</p>

<p>We have now to consider what were the speculative
motives that led Aristotle to overlook these contradictions,
and to find rest in a theory even less satisfactory than the
earlier systems which he is always attacking with relentless
animosity. The first motive, we believe, was the train of
reasoning, already laid before the reader, by which universal
essences, the objects of knowledge, gradually came to be
identified with particular objects, the sole existing realities.
For the arguments against such an identification, as put
forward by our philosopher himself, still remained unanswered.
The individuals comprising a species were still too
transient for certainty and too numerous for comprehension.
But when for the antithesis between Form and Matter was
substituted the antithesis between Actuality and Possibility,
two modes of evasion presented themselves. The first was to
distinguish between actual knowledge and potential knowledge.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
The former corresponded to existing particulars, the latter to
general ideas.<a id="FNanchor_253_253" href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">253</a> This, however, besides breaking up the unity
of knowledge, was inconsistent with the whole tenor of
Aristotle’s previous teaching. What can be more actual than
demonstration, and how can there be any demonstration of
transient particulars? The other mode of reconciliation was
perhaps suggested by the need of an external cause to raise
Possibility into Actuality. Such a cause might be conceived
with all the advantages and without the drawbacks of a
Platonic Idea. It would be at once the moving agent and
the model of perfection; it could reconcile the general and
the particular by the simple fact of being eternal in time,
comprehensive in space, and unique in kind. Aristotle found
such a cause, or rather a whole series of such causes, in the
celestial spheres. In his system, these bear just the same
relation to terrestrial phenomena that Plato’s Ideas bear to
the world of sense. They are, in fact, the Ideas made sensible
and superficial, placed alongside of, instead of beneath or
behind, the transient particulars which they irradiate and
sustain.</p>

<p>The analogy may be carried even farther. If Plato
regarded the things of sense as not merely a veil, but an
imperfect imitation of the only true realities; so also did
Aristotle represent the sublunary elements as copying the
disposition and activities of the ethereal spheres. They too
have their concentric arrangements—first fire, then air, then
water, and lastly earth in the centre; while their perpetual
transformation into one another presents an image in time of
the spatial rotation which those sublime beings perform. And
although we think that Sir A. Grant is quite mistaken in
identifying Aristotle’s Supreme Mind with the Idea of Good,
there can be no doubt of its having been suggested by that
Idea. It is, in fact, the translation of Plato’s abstraction into
concrete reality, and the completion of a process which Plato<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
had himself begun. From another point of view we may say
that both master and disciple were working, each in his own
way, at the solution of a problem which entirely dominates
Greek philosophy from Empedocles on—the reconciliation
of Parmenides and Heracleitus, Being and Becoming,
the eternal and the changeful, the one and the many. Aristotle
adopts the superficial, external method of placing the
two principles side by side in space; and for a long time the
world accepted his solution for the same reason that had
commended it to his own acceptance, its apparent agreement
with popular tradition and with the facts of experience. It
must be confessed, however, that here also he was following
the lines laid down by Plato. The <cite>Timaeus</cite> and the <cite>Laws</cite>
are marked by a similar tendency to substitute astronomy
for dialectics, to study the celestial movements with religious
veneration, to rebuild on a scientific basis that ancient star-worship
which, even among the Greeks, enjoyed a much
higher authority and prestige than the humanised mythology
of the poets. But for Christianity this star-worship would
probably have become the official faith of the Roman world.
As it is, Dante’s great poem presents us with a singular
compromise between the two creeds. The crystalline
spheres are retained, only they have become the abode of
glorified spirits instead of being the embodiment of eternal
gods. We often hear it said that the Copernican system was
rejected as offensive to human pride, because it removed the
earth from the centre of the universe. This is a profound
mistake. Its offence was to degrade the heavenly bodies by
assimilating them to the earth.<a id="FNanchor_254_254" href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">254</a> Among several planets, all
revolving round the sun, there could not be any marked
qualitative difference. In the theological sense there was no
longer any heaven; and with the disappearance of the solid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
sidereal sphere there was no longer any necessity for a Prime
Mover.</p>

<p>There is, perhaps, no passage in Aristotle’s writings—there
is certainly none in his scientific writings—more eloquent
than that which describes the glory of his imaginary heavens.
The following translation may give some faint idea of its
solemnity and splendour:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We believe, then, that the whole heaven is one and everlasting,
without beginning or end through all eternity, but holding infinite
time within its orb; not, as some say, created or capable of being
destroyed. We believe it on account of the grounds already stated,
and also on account of the consequences resulting from a different
hypothesis. For, it must add great weight to our assurance of its
immortality and everlasting duration that this opinion may, while the
contrary opinion cannot possibly, be true. Wherefore, we may
trust the traditions of old time, and especially of our own race, when
they tell us that there is something deathless and divine about the
things which, although moving, have a movement that is not bounded,
but is itself the universal bound, a perfect circle enclosing in its revolutions
the imperfect motions that are subject to restraint and
arrest; while this, being without beginning or end or rest through
infinite time, is the one from which all others originate, and into
which they disappear. That heaven which antiquity assigned to
the gods as an immortal abode, is shown by the present argument to
be uncreated and indestructible, exempt alike from mortal weakness
and from the weariness of subjection to a force acting in opposition
to its natural inclination; for in proportion to its everlasting continuance
such a compulsion would be laborious, and unparticipant in
the highest perfection of design. We must not, then, believe with
the old mythologists that an Atlas is needed to uphold it; for they,
like some in more recent times, fancied that the heavens were made
of heavy earthy matter, and so fabled an animated necessity for their
support; nor yet that, as Empedocles says, they will last only so
long as their own proper momentum is exceeded by the whirling
motion of which they partake.<a id="FNanchor_255_255" href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">255</a> Nor, again, is it likely that their everlasting
revolution can be kept up by the exercise of a conscious will;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
for no soul could lead a happy and blessed existence that was engaged
in such a task, necessitating, as it would, an unceasing struggle with
their native tendency to move in a different direction, without even
the mental relaxation and bodily rest which mortals gain by sleep,
but doomed to the eternal torment of an Ixion’s wheel. Our
explanation, on the other hand, is, as we say, not only more consistent
with the eternity of the heavens, but also can alone be reconciled
with the acknowledged vaticinations of religious faith.<a id="FNanchor_256_256" href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">256</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It will be seen from the foregoing passage how strong
a hold the old Greek notion of an encircling limit had on
the mind of Aristotle, and how he transformed it back from
the high intellectual significance given to it by Plato into its
original sense of a mere space-enclosing figure. And it will
also be seen how he credits his spheres with a full measure of
that moving power which, according to his rather unfair
criticism, the Platonic Ideas did not possess. His astronomy
also supplied him with that series of graduated transitions
between two extremes in which Greek thought so much
delighted. The heavenly bodies mediate between God and
the earth; partly active and partly passive, they both receive
and communicate the moving creative impulse. The four
terrestrial elements are moved in the various categories of
substance, quantity, quality, and place; the aether moves in
place only. God remains ‘without variableness or shadow of
a change.’ Finally, by its absolute simplicity and purity, the
aether mediates between the coarse matter perceived by our
senses and the absolutely immaterial Nous, and is itself
supposed to be pervaded by a similar gradation of fineness
from top to bottom. Furthermore, the upper fire, which
must not be confounded with flame, furnishes a connecting
link between the aether and the other elements, being related
to them as Form to Matter, or as agent to patient; and,
when the elements are decomposed into their constituent
qualities, hot and cold occupy a similar position with regard
to wet and dry.</p>

<h3><a id="VII-IV"></a>IV.</h3>

<p>In mastering Aristotle’s cosmology, we have gained the
key to his entire method of systematisation. Henceforth, the
Stagirite has no secrets from us. Where we were formerly
content to show that he erred, we can now show why he
erred; by generalising his principles of arrangement, we can
exhibit them still more clearly in their conflict with modern
thought. The method, then, pursued by Aristotle is to divide
his subject into two more or less unequal masses, one of which
is supposed to be governed by necessary principles, admitting
of certain demonstration; while the other is irregular, and
can only be studied according to the rules of probable
evidence. The parts of the one are homogeneous and concentrically
disposed, the movements of each being controlled
by that immediately outside and above it. The parts of the
other are heterogeneous and distributed among a number of
antithetical pairs, between whose members there is, or ought
to be, a general equilibrium preserved, the whole system
having a common centre which either oscillates from one
extreme to another, or holds the balance between them.
The second system is enclosed within the first, and is
altogether dependent on it for the impulses determining its
processes of metamorphosis and equilibration. Where the
internal adjustments of a system to itself or of one system to
the other are not consciously made, Aristotle calls them
Nature. They are always adapted to secure its everlasting
continuance either in an individual or a specific form.
Actuality belongs more particularly to the first sphere, and
possibility to the second, but both are, to a certain extent,
represented in each.</p>

<p>We have already seen how this fundamental division is
applied to the universe as a whole. But our philosopher is
not content with classifying the phenomena as he finds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
them; he attempts to demonstrate the necessity of their dual
existence; and in so doing is guilty of something very like a
vicious circle. For, after proving from the terrestrial movements
that there must be an eternal movement to keep them
going, he now assumes the revolving aether, and argues that
there must be a motionless solid centre for it to revolve round,
although a geometrical axis would have served the purpose
equally well. By a still more palpable fallacy, he proceeds
to show that a body whose tendency is towards the centre,
must, in the nature of things, be opposed by another body
whose tendency is towards the circumference. In order to
fill up the interval created by this opposition, two intermediate
bodies are required, and thus we get the four elements—earth,
water, air, and fire. These, again, are resolved
into the antithetical couples, dry and wet, hot and cold, the
possible combinations of which, by twos, give us the four
elements once more. Earth is dry and cold, water cold and
wet, air wet and hot, fire hot and dry; each adjacent pair
having a quality in common, and each element being characterized
by the excess of a particular quality; earth is
especially dry, water cold, air wet, and fire hot. The common
centre of each antithesis is what Aristotle calls the First
Matter, the mere abstract unformed possibility of existence.
This matter always combines two qualities, and has the power
of oscillating from one quality to another, but it cannot, as a
rule, simultaneously exchange both for their opposites. Earth
may pass into water, exchanging dry for wet, but not so
readily into air, which would necessitate a double exchange at
the same moment.</p>

<p>Those who will may see in all this an anticipation of
chemical substitution and double decomposition. We can
assure them that it will be by no means the most absurd
parallel discovered between ancient and modern ideas. It is
possible, however, to trace a more real connexion between the
Aristotelian physics and mediaeval thought. We do not of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
course mean the scholastic philosophy, for there never was
the slightest doubt as to its derivation; we allude to the
alchemy and astrology which did duty for positive science
during so many centuries, and even overlapped it down to the
time of Newton, himself an ardent alchemist. The superstitions
of astrology originated independently of the peripatetic
system, and probably long before it, but they were likely
to be encouraged by it instead of being repressed, as they
would have been by a less anthropomorphic philosophy.
Aristotle himself, as we have seen, limited the action of the
heavens on the sublunary sphere to their heating power; but,
by crediting them with an immortal reason and the pursuit
of ends unknown to us, he opened a wide field for conjecture
as to what those ends were, and how they could be ascertained.
That the stars and planets were always thinking and acting,
but never about our affairs, was not a notion likely to be
permanently accepted. Neither was it easy to believe that
their various configurations, movements, and names (the last
probably revealed by themselves) were entirely without significance.
From such considerations to the casting of horoscopes
is not a far remove. The Aristotelian chemistry would
still more readily lend itself to the purposes of alchemy. If
Nature is one vast process of transmutation, then particular
bodies, such as the metals, not only may, but must be convertible
into one another. And even those who rejected
Aristotle’s logic with scorn still clung to his natural philosophy
when it flattered their hopes of gain. Bacon kept the
theory of substantial forms. His originality consisted in
looking for a method by which any form, or assemblage of
forms might be superinduced at pleasure on the underlying
matter. The real development of knowledge pursued
a far different course. The great discoverers of the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries achieved their success by absolutely
reversing the method of Aristotle, by bringing into fruitful
contact principles which he had condemned to barren isolation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
They carried terrestrial physics into the heavens; they
brought down the absoluteness and eternity of celestial law to
earth; they showed that Aristotle’s antithetical qualities were
merely quantitative distinctions. These they resolved into
modes of motion; and they also resolved all motions into one,
which was both rectilinear and perpetual. But they and their
successors put an end to all dreams of transmutation, when
they showed by another synthesis that all matter, at least
within the limits of our experience, has the changeless consistency
once attributed exclusively to the stellar spheres.</p>

<p>When Aristotle passes from the whole cosmos to the philosophy
of life, his method of systematic division is less distinctly
illustrated, but still it may be traced. The fundamental separation
is between body and soul. The latter has a wider
meaning than what we associate with it at present. It covers
the psychic functions and the whole life of the organism, which,
again, is not what we mean by life. For life with us is both
individual and collective; it resides in each speck of protoplasm,
and also in the consensus of the whole organism.
With Aristotle it is more exclusively a central principle, the
final cause of the organism, the power which holds it together,
and by which it was originally shaped. Biology begins by
determining the idea of the whole, and then considers the
means by which it is realised. The psychic functions are
arranged according to a system of teleological subordination.
The lower precedes the higher in time, but is logically necessitated
by it. Thus nutrition, or the vegetative life in general,
must be studied in close connexion with sensation and impulse,
or animal life; and this, again, with thought or pure reasoning.
On the other hand, anatomy and physiology are
considered from a purely chemical and mechanical point of
view. A vital purpose is, indeed, assigned to every organ,
but with no more reference to its specifically vital properties
than if it formed part of a steam engine. Here, as always with
Aristotle, the idea of moderation determines the point of view<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
whence the inferior or material system is to be studied.
Organic tissue is made up of the four elemental principles—hot,
cold, wet, and dry—mixed together in proper proportions;
and the object of organic function is to maintain them in due
equilibrium, an end effected by the regulating power of the
soul, which, accordingly, has its seat in the heart or centre of
the body. It has been already shown how, in endeavouring
to work out this chimerical theory, Aristotle went much
further astray from the truth than sundry other Greek physiologists
less biassed by the requirements of a symmetrical
method.</p>

<p>After the formal and material elements of life have been
separately discussed, there comes an account of the process
by which they are first brought into connexion, for this is how
Aristotle views generation. With him it is the information
of matter by psychic force; and his notions about the part
which each parent plays in the production of a new being
are vitiated throughout by this mistaken assumption. Nevertheless
his treatise on the subject is, for its time, one of the
most wonderful works ever written, and, as we are told on
good authority,<a id="FNanchor_257_257" href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> is now less antiquated than the corresponding
researches of Harvey. The philosopher’s peculiar genius for
observation, analysis, and comparison will partly account for
his success; but, if we mistake not, there is another and less
obvious reason. Here the fatal separation of form and matter
was, except at first starting, precluded by the very idea of
generation; and the teleological principle of spontaneous efforts
to realise a predetermined end was, as it happened, perfectly
in accordance with the facts themselves.</p>

<p>And now, looking back on his cosmology, we can see that
Aristotle was never so near the truth as when he tried to
bridge over the gulf between his two spheres, the one corruptible
and the other eternal, by the idea of motion considered
as a specific property of all matter, and persisting through all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
time; as a link between the celestial revolutions and the
changes occurring on or near the earth’s surface; and, finally,
as the direct cause of heat, the great agent acting in opposition
to gravity—which last view may have suggested Bacon’s
capital discovery, that heat is itself a mode of motion.</p>

<p>Another method by which Aristotle strove to overcome
the antithesis between life as a mechanical arrangement and
life as a metaphysical conception, was the newly created study
of comparative anatomy. The variations in structure and
function which accompany variations in the environment,
though statically and not dynamically conceived, bring us
very near to the truth that biological phenomena are subject
to the same general laws of causation as all other phenomena;
and it is this truth which, in the science of life, corresponds to
the identification of terrestrial with celestial physics in the
science of general mechanics. Vitality is not an individualised
principle stationed in the heart and serving only to
balance opposite forces against one another; but it is diffused
through all the tissues, and bestows on them that extraordinary
plasticity which responds to the actions of the environment
by spontaneous variations capable of being summed up in any
direction, and so creating entirely new organic forms without
the intervention of any supernatural agency.</p>


<h3><a id="VII-V"></a>V.</h3>

<p>We have now to consider how Aristotle treats psychology,
not in connexion with biology, but as a distinct science—a
separation not quite consistent with his own definition of soul,
but forced on him by the traditions of Greek philosophy and
by the nature of things. Here the fundamental antithesis
assumes a three-fold form. First the theoretical activity of
mind is distinguished from its practical activity; the one being
exercised on things which cannot, the other on things which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
can, be changed. Again, a similar distinction prevails within
the special province of each. Where truth is the object, knowledge
stands opposed to sense; where good is sought, reason
rises superior to passion. The one antithesis had been introduced
into philosophy by the early physicists, the other by
Socrates. They were confounded in the psychology of Plato,
and Aristotle had the merit of separating them once more. Yet
even he preserves a certain artificial parallelism between them
by using the common name Nous, or reason, to denote the controlling
member in each. To make his anthropology still more
complex, there is a third antithesis to be taken into account,
that between the individual and the community, which also
sometimes slides into a partial coincidence with the other two.</p>

<p>Aristotle’s treatise on the soul is mainly devoted to a description
of the theoretical faculties—sense, and thought or
reason. By sense we become acquainted with the material
qualities of things; by thought with their forms or ideas. It
has been already mentioned that, according to our philosopher,
the organism is a system of contrary forces held in equilibrium
by the soul, whose seat he supposes to be in the heart. We
now learn that every sensation is a disturbance of this equilibrium.
In other words, the sensorium being virtually any
and every mode of matter, is raised from possibility to actuality
by the presence of some one force, such as heat or cold,
in sufficient strength to incline the balance that way. Here
we have, quite in Aristotle’s usual style, a description instead
of an explanation. The atomic notion of thin films thrown
off from the object of sense, and falling on the organs of sight
or touch, was but a crude guess; still it has more affinity with
the discoveries of a Young or a Helmholtz than scholastic
phrases about potentiality and actuality. That sensation
implies a disturbance of equilibrium is, indeed, an important
truth; only, the equilibrium must be conceived as a balance,
not of possible sensations, but of molecular states; that is to
say, it must be interpreted according to the atomic theory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span></p>

<p>Aristotle is more successful when he proceeds to discuss
the imagination. He explains it to be a continuance of the
movement originally communicated by the felt object to the
organ of sense, kept up in the absence of the object itself;—as
near an approach to the truth as could be made in his time.
And he is also right in saying that the operations of reason
are only made possible by the help of what he calls phantasms—that
is, faint reproductions of sensations. In addition to
this, he points out the connexion between memory and imagination,
and enumerates the laws of association briefly, but
with great accuracy. He is, however, altogether unaware of
their scope. So far from using them to explain all the mental
processes, he does not even see that they account for involuntary
reminiscence, and limits them to the voluntary operation
by which we recall a missing name or other image to consciousness.</p>

<p>So far, Aristotle regards the soul as a function, or energy,
or perfection of the body, from which it can no more be separated
than vision from the eye. It is otherwise with the
part of mind which he calls Nous, or Reason—the faculty
which takes cognisance of abstract ideas or the pure forms of
things. This corresponds, in the microcosm, to the eternal
Nous of the macrocosm, and, like it, is absolutely immaterial,
not depending for its activity on the exercise of any bodily
organ. There is, however, a general analogy between sensation
and thought considered as processes of cognition. Previous
to experience, the Nous is no thought in particular, but
merely a possibility of thinking, like a smooth wax tablet
waiting to be written on. It is determined to some particular
idea by contact with the objective forms of things, and in this
determination is raised from power to actuality. The law of
moderation, however, does not apply to thought. Excessive
stimulation is first injurious and then destructive to the
organs of sense, but we cannot have too much of an idea; the
more intense it is the better are we able to conceive all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
ideas that come under it, just because ideation is an incorporeal
process. And there seems to be this further distinction
between sensation and thought, that the latter is much more
completely identified with its object than the former; it is in
the very act of imprinting themselves on the Nous that the
forms of things become perfectly detached from matter, and
so attain their final realisation. It is only in our consciousness
that the eternal ideas of transient phenomena become
conscious of themselves. Such, we take it, is the true interpretation
of Aristotle’s famous distinction between an active
and a passive Nous. The one, he tells us, <em>makes</em> whatever
the other is <em>made</em>. The active Nous is like light raising
colours from possibility to actuality. It is eternal, but we have
no remembrance of its past existence, because the passive
Nous, without which it can think nothing, is perishable.</p>

<p>It will be seen that we do not consider the two kinds of
Nous to differ from each other as a higher and a lower faculty.
This, in our opinion, has been the great mistake of the commentators,
of those, at least, who do not identify the active
Nous with God, or with some agency emanating from God—a
hypothesis utterly inconsistent with Aristotle’s theology.
They describe it as a faculty, and as concerned with some
higher kind of knowledge than what lies within the reach of
the passive Nous.<a id="FNanchor_258_258" href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> But with Aristotle faculty is always a
potentiality and a passive recipient, whereas the creative
reason is expressly declared to be an actuality, which, in this
connexion, can mean nothing but an individual idea. The
difficulty is to understand why the objective forms of things
should suddenly be spoken of as existing within the mind,
and denominated by a term carrying with it such subjective
associations as Nous; a difficulty not diminished by the mysterious
comparison with light in its relation to colour, an illus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>tration
which, in this instance, has only made the darkness
visible. We believe that Aristotle was led to express himself
as he did by the following considerations. He began by
simply conceiving that, just as the senses were raised from
potency to actuality through contact with the corresponding
qualities in external objects, so also was the reasoning faculty
moulded into particular thoughts through contact with the
particular things embodying them; thus, for instance, it was
led to conceive the general idea of straightness by actual experience
of straight lines. It then, perhaps, occurred to him
that one and the same object could not produce two such
profoundly different impressions as a sensation and a thought;
that mind was opposed to external realities by the attribute
of self-consciousness; and that a form inherent in matter could
not directly impress itself on an immaterial substance. The
idea of a creative Nous was, we think, devised in order to
escape from these perplexities. The ideal forms of things are
carried into the mind, together with the sensations, and in
passing through the imagination, become purified from the
matter previously associated with them. Thus they may be
conceived as part of the mind—in, though not yet of it—and as
acting on its highest faculty, the passive Nous. And, by a
kind of anticipation, they are called by the name of what they
become completely identified with in cognition. As forms of
things they are eternal; as thoughts they are self-conscious;
while, in both capacities, they are creative, and their creative
activity is an essentially immaterial process. Here we have
the old confusion between form and function; the old
inability to reconcile the claims of the universal and the particular
in knowledge and existence. After all, Aristotle is
obliged to extract an actuality from the meeting of two possibilities,
instead of from the meeting of an actuality and a
possibility. Probably the weakness of his own theory did not
escape him, for he never subsequently recurs to it.<a id="FNanchor_259_259" href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">259</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span></p>

<p>Aristotle’s work on reproduction is supposed by many to
contain a reference to his distinction between the two Reasons,
but we are convinced that this is a mistake. What we are
told is that at the very first formation of a new being, the
vegetative soul, being an exclusively corporeal function, is
precontained in the elements furnished by the female; that
the sensitive soul is contributed by the male (being, apparently,
engendered in the semen by the vital heat of the parent
organism); and, finally, that the rational soul, although entirely
immaterial, is also carried in with the semen, into which it
has first been introduced from without, but where, or when,
or how is not more particularly specified.<a id="FNanchor_260_260" href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">260</a> But even were
the genetic theory in question perfectly cleared up, it would
still throw no light on the distinction between active and passive
reason, as the latter alone can be understood by the
rational soul to which it refers. For we are expressly informed—what
indeed hardly required to be stated—that the embryonic
souls exist not in act but in potency.<a id="FNanchor_261_261" href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">261</a> It seems, therefore,
that Mr. Edwin Wallace is doubly mistaken when he
quotes a sentence from this passage in justification of his
statement, that ‘Aristotle would seem almost to identify’ the
creative reason ‘with God as the eternal and omnipresent
thinker;’<a id="FNanchor_262_262" href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">262</a> first, because it does not refer to the creative Nous
at all; and, secondly, because, if it did, the words would not
stand the meaning which he puts upon them.<a id="FNanchor_263_263" href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">263</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span></p>

<p>But if even so little as this remains unproved, what are we
to think of the astounding assertion, that ‘Aristotle’s theory
of a creative reason, fragmentary as that theory is left, is
the answer to all materialistic theories of the universe. To
Aristotle, as to a subtle Scottish preacher,<a id="FNanchor_264_264" href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">264</a> “the real pre-supposition
of all knowledge, or the thought which is the <i lang="la">prius</i> of
all things, is not the individual’s consciousness of himself as
individual, but a thought or self-consciousness which is beyond
all individual selves, which is the unity of all individual selves,
and their objects, of all thinkers and all objects of thought.”’<a id="FNanchor_265_265" href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">265</a>
How can materialism or anything else be possibly refuted by
a theory which is so obscurely set forth that no two interpreters
are able to agree in their explanation of it? And even were
it stated with perfect clearness and fulness, how can any
hypothesis be refuted by a mere dogmatic declaration of
Aristotle? Are we back in the Middle Ages that his <i lang="la">ipse
dixit</i> is to decide questions now raised with far ampler means
of discussion than he could possess? As to Principal Caird’s
metaphysics, we have no wish to dispute their theoretic
accuracy, and can only admire the liberality of a Church in
which propositions so utterly destructive of traditional orthodoxy
are allowed to be preached. But one thing we are
certain of, and that is, that whether or not they are consistent
with Christian theism, they are utterly inconsistent with
Aristotelian principles. Which is the ‘thought or self-consciousness’
referred to, a possibility or an actuality? If the
former, it is not a <i lang="la">prius</i>, nor is it the creative reason. If the
latter, it cannot transcend all or any individual selves, for,
with Aristotle, individuals are the sole reality, and the
supreme being of his system is pre-eminently individual;
neither can it unify them, for, according to Aristotle, two
things which are two in actuality cannot be one in actuality.<a id="FNanchor_266_266" href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">266</a></p>

<p>We now turn to Sir A. Grant, who, as was mentioned at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
the beginning of the last chapter, makes Aristotle a supporter
of the late Prof. Ferrier. We will state the learned Principal’s
view in his own words:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘His utterances on this subject [the existence of an external world]
are perhaps chiefly to be found in the third book of his treatise “On
the Soul,” beginning with the fourth chapter. On turning to them
we see that he never separates existence from knowledge. “A thing
in actual existence,” he says, “is identical with the knowledge of that
thing.” Again, “The possible existence of a thing is identical with
the possibility in us of perceiving or knowing it.” Thus, until a thing
is perceived or known, it can only be said to have a potential or
possible existence. And from this a doctrine very similar to that of
Ferrier might be deduced, that “nothing exists except <em>plus</em> me,”—that
is to say, in relation to some mind perceiving it.‘ (<i>Aristotle</i>, p. 165.)</p></blockquote>

<p>After much searching, we have not been able to find the
originals of the two passages quoted by Sir A. Grant. We
have, however, found others setting forth the doctrine of
Natural Realism with a clearness which leaves nothing to be
desired. Aristotle tells us that former naturalists were wrong
when they said that there could be no black or white without
vision, and no taste without tasting; that is, they were right
about the actuality, and wrong about the possibility; for, as
he explains, our sensations are produced by the action of
external bodies on the appropriate organs, the activity being
the same while the existence is different. A sonorous body
produces a sound in our hearing; the sound perceived and
the action of the body are identical, but not their existence;
for, he adds, the hearer need not be always listening, nor the
sonorous body sounding; and so with all the other senses.<a id="FNanchor_267_267" href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">267</a></p>

<p>This is not making the <i lang="la">percipi</i> of objects their <i lang="la">esse</i>. Again,
in the eighth chapter he tells us that the soul is ‘in a certain
way’ (πῶς) all things, since all things are either sensible or
cogitable; and then he proceeds to explain what is meant by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
‘in a certain way.’ Sense and knowledge are distributed over
things in such wise that their possibility is the possibility, and
their actuality the actuality, of the things. They must, then,
be either the things themselves or their forms. ‘<em>But the
things themselves they are surely not</em>, for the stone is not in the
soul, but its form.’ In the <cite>Metaphysics</cite>, Aristotle expresses
himself to the same effect, but even more explicitly. Criticising
the Protagorean doctrine, he reduces it to an absurdity by
urging that if there were nothing but sensibles, then nothing
at all could exist in the absence of animated beings, for
without them there would be no sensation. He admits that in
the case supposed there would be neither feelings nor felt
objects, since these presuppose a sentient subject; but adds,
that for the substances (τὰ ὑποκείμενα) which produce the feeling
not to exist is impossible; ‘for there is something else
besides the feeling which must necessarily exist before it.’<a id="FNanchor_268_268" href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">268</a>
And immediately afterwards he clinches the argument by observing
that if appearances were the only truth, there would
be no independent existences, and everything would be relative,
since appearances exist only in relation to some one to
whom they appear. Now we need hardly say that this universal
relativity was precisely what Ferrier contended for.</p>

<p>Sir A. Grant is on stronger, or rather on more inaccessible
ground, when he uses the distinction between the two reasons
as involving a sort of idealistic theory, because here Aristotle’s
meaning is much less clearly expressed. Yet, if our interpretation
be the correct one, if the creative Nous simply means
the forms of things acting through the imagination on the
possibilities of subjective conception, Aristotle’s view will be
exactly the reverse of that contended for by Sir Alexander;
thought, instead of moulding, will itself be moulded by external
reality. In no case have we a right to set an obscure
and disputed passage against Aristotle’s distinct, emphatic,
and reiterated declarations, that sensation and ideation are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
substantially analogous processes, taken together with his
equally distinct declaration, that the objects of sensation are
independent of our feelings. We think, indeed, that Sir A.
Grant will find, on reconsideration, that he is proving too
much. For, if the things which reason creates were external
to the mind, then Aristotle would go at least as far as those
‘extreme German idealists’ from whom his expositor is
anxious to separate him. Finally, we would observe that to
set up Aristotle’s distinction between form and matter in
opposition to the materialistic theories of the present day,
shows a profound misconception of its meaning. Form and
matter are nowhere distinguished from one another as subject
and object. Form simply means the attributes of a thing, the
entire aggregate of its differential characteristics. But that
this does not of itself amount to conscious reason we are told
by Aristotle himself.<a id="FNanchor_269_269" href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">269</a> On the other hand, the ‘matter’ to
which ‘some philosophers’ attribute ‘an independent existence,’
is not his ‘matter’ at all, but just the sum of things
<em>minus</em> consciousness. The Stagirite did not, it is true, believe
in the possibility of such a universe, but only (as we have
shown) because he was not acquainted with the highest laws
of motion. Yet, even taking ‘matter’ in his own technical
sense, Aristotle would have agreed with Prof. Tyndall, that
it contained the promise and the potency of all future life,
reason alone excepted. He tells us very clearly that the
sensitive soul is a somatic function, something which, although
not body, belongs to body; and this we conceive is all that
any materialist would now contend for.<a id="FNanchor_270_270" href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">270</a> And having gone
so far, there really was nothing to prevent him from going a
step farther, had he only been acquainted with the dependence
of all intelligence on nervous action. At any rate, the tendency
is now to obliterate the distinction where he drew it,
and to substitute for it another distinction which he neglected.
While all functions of consciousness, from the most elementary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
sensation to the most complex reasoning, seem to pass into
one another by imperceptible gradations, consciousness in
general is still separated from objective existence by an impassable
chasm; and if there is any hope of reconciling them
it lies in the absolute idealism which he so summarily rejected.
What we have had occasion repeatedly to point out in other
departments of his system, is verified once more in his psychology.
The progress of thought has resulted from a
reunion of the principles between which he drew a rigid demarcation.
We have found that perception can only be understood
as a process essentially homogeneous with the highest
thought, and neither more nor less immaterial than it is. On
the objective side, both may be resolved into sensori-motor
actions; on the subjective side, into groups of related feelings.
And here, also, we have to note that when Aristotle anticipates
modern thought, it is through his one great mediating,
synthetic conception. He observes incidentally that our knowledge
of size and shape is acquired, not through the special
senses, but by motion—an aperçu much in advance of Locke.<a id="FNanchor_271_271" href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">271</a></p>

<p>If there are any who value Aristotle as a champion of
spiritualism, they must take him with his encumbrances. If
his philosophy proves that one part of the soul is immaterial,
it proves equally that the soul, taking it altogether, is perishable.
Not only does he reject Plato’s metempsychosis as
inconsistent with physiology, but he declares that affection,
memory, and reasoning are functions not of the eternal Nous,
but of the whole man, and come to an end with his dissolution.
As to the active Nous, he tells us that it cannot think without
the assistance of the passive Nous, which is mortal. And there
are various passages in the ‘Nicomachean Ethics’ showing that
he had faced this negation of a future life, and was perfectly resigned
to its consequences.<a id="FNanchor_272_272" href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">272</a> At one period of his life, probably
when under the immediate influence of Plato, he had indulged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
in dreams of immortality; but a profounder acquaintance
with natural science sufficed to dissipate them. Perhaps a
lingering veneration for his teacher made him purposely use
ambiguous language in reference to the eternity of that
creative reason which he had so closely associated with self-consciousness.
It may remind us of Spinoza’s celebrated
proposition, <i lang="la">Sentimus experimurque nos aeternos esse</i>, words
absolutely disconnected with the hope of a continued existence
of the individual after death, but apparently intended to enlist
some of the sentiment associated with that belief on the side
of the writer’s own philosophy.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the spirit of Plato’s religion survived in
the teaching of his disciple under a new form. The idea of an
eternal personality was, as it were, unified and made objective
by being transferred from the human to the divine; and so each
philosopher developes an aspect of religious faith which is
wanting in the other, thereby illustrating the tendencies, to
some extent mutually exclusive; which divide all theology
between them. It remains to observe that if even Aristotle’s
theism is inconsistent with the Catholic faith, much more must
his psychology be its direct negation. <em>The</em> Philosophy of <em>the</em>
Philosopher is as fatal to the Church’s doctrine of future
rewards and punishments as it is to her doctrine of divine
interference with the usual order of nature.</p>


<h3><a id="VII-VI"></a>VI.</h3>

<p>We now pass to the consideration of Aristotle’s most
important achievement—his system of logic. And as, here
also, we shall find much to criticise, it is as well to begin by
saying that, in our opinion, his contributions to the science
are the most valuable ever made, and perhaps have done
more to advance it than all other writings on the same subject
put together.</p>

<p>The principal business of reason is, as we have seen, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
form abstract ideas or concepts of things. But before the
time of Aristotle it had already been discovered that concepts,
or rather the terms expressing them, were capable of
being united in propositions which might be either true or
false, and whose truth might be a matter either of certainty
or of simple opinion. Now, in modern psychology, down to
the most recent times, it has always been assumed that, just
as there is an intellectual faculty or operation called abstraction
corresponding to the terms of which a proposition is
composed, so also there is a faculty or operation called judgment
corresponding to the entire proposition. Sometimes,
again, the third operation, which consists in linking propositions
together to form syllogisms, is assigned to a distinct
faculty called reason; sometimes all three are regarded as
ascending steps in a single fundamental process. Neither
Plato nor Aristotle, however, had thought out the subject so
scientifically. To both the framing, or rather the discovery,
of concepts was by far the most important business of a
philosopher, judgment and reasoning being merely subsidiary
to it. Hence, while in one part of their logic they were realists
and conceptualists, in other parts they were nominalists.
Abstract names and the definitions unfolding their connotation
corresponded to actual entities in Nature—the eternal
Ideas of the one and the substantial forms of the other—as
well as to mental representations about whose existence they
were agreed, while ascribing to them a different origin. But
they did not in like manner treat propositions as the expression
of natural laws without, or of judgments within, the
mind; while reasoning they regarded much more as an art of
thinking, a method for the discovery of ideas, than as the
Systematisation of a process spontaneously performed by
every human being without knowing it; and, even as such,
their tendency is to connect it with the theory of definition
rather than with the theory of synthetic propositions. Some
approach to a realistic view is, indeed, made by both. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
restless and penetrating thought of Plato had, probably
towards the close of his career, led him to enquire into the
mutual relations of those Ideas which he had at first been inclined
to regard as absolutely distinct. He shows us in the
<cite>Sophist</cite> how the most abstract notions, such as Being, Identity,
and so forth, must, to a certain extent, partake of each
other’s nature; and when their relationship does not lie on
the surface, he seeks to establish it by the interposition of a
third idea obviously connected with both. In the later books
of the <cite>Republic</cite> he also points to a scheme for arranging his
Ideas according to a fixed hierarchy resembling the concatenation
of mathematical proofs, by ascending and descending
whose successive gradations the mind is to become familiarised
with absolute truth; and we shall presently see how Aristotle,
following in the same track, sought for a counterpart to his
syllogistic method in the objective order of things. Nevertheless,
with him, as well as with his master, science was not
what it is with us, a study of laws, a perpetually growing body
of truth, but a process of definition and classification, a
systematisation of what had already been perceived and
thought.</p>

<p>It was from the initiative of Socrates that logic received
this direction. By insisting on the supreme importance of
definition, he drew away attention from the propositions
which add to our knowledge, and concentrated it on those
which only fix with precision the meaning of words. Yet, in
so doing he was influenced quite as much by the spirit of the
older physical philosophy, which he denounced, as by the
necessities of the new humanistic culture, which he helped to
introduce. His definitions were, in truth, the reproduction,
on a very minute scale, of those attempts to formulate the
whole universe which busied the earliest Ionian speculation.
Following the natural tendency of Greek thought, and
the powerful attraction of cosmic philosophy, an effort was
speedily made to generalise and connect these partial defini<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>tions
until they grew into a system of universal classification.
It was when, under the influence of a new analysis, this
system threatened to fall to pieces, that a rudimentary doctrine
of judgment first made its appearance. The structure of a
grammatical sentence was used to explain how objective
ideas could, in a manner, overlap and adhere to one another.
Hence propositions, which, as the expression of general truths,
were destined to become the beginning and end of thought,
remained at first strictly subordinated to the individual concepts
that they linked and reconciled.</p>

<p>With Aristotle propositions assumed a new importance.
He looked on them as mediating, not only between concepts,
but also between conception and reasoning. Still, neither as
a psychologist nor as a logician did he appreciate them at their
real value. A very brief consideration is given to judgment
in his work on the soul, and we are left in doubt whether it is
a function of Nous alone or of Nous combined with some other
faculty. Setting aside the treatise on Interpretation, which
is probably spurious, and, at any rate, throws no new light on
the subject, we may gather from his logical writings half a
dozen different suggestions towards a classification of propositions,
based partly on their form and partly on their import.
In all we find an evident tendency to apply, here also, his
grand fundamental distinction between the sphere of uniformity
and the sphere of change and opposition. All propositions
are either universal or particular; either positive or negative;
either necessary or actual or contingent; either reciprocating
or not reciprocating; either essential or accidental; either
answering to the first question in the categories, or to one of
the other nine.<a id="FNanchor_273_273" href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">273</a> But nowhere is any attempt made to combine
and systematise these various points of view.</p>

<p>In the theory of reasoning the simple proposition is taken
as a starting-point; but instead of deducing the syllogism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
from the synthesis of two premises, Aristotle reaches the
premises through the conclusion. He tells us, indeed, that
reasoning is a way of discovering from what we know, something
that we did not know before. With him, however, it is
really a process not of discovery but of proof. He starts
with the conclusion, analyses it into predicate and subject or
major and minor, and then, by a further analysis, introduces
a middle term connecting the two. Thus, we begin with the
proposition, ‘Caius is mortal,’ and prove it by interpolating
the notion humanity between its two extremes. From this
point of view the premises are merely a temporary scaffolding
for bringing the major and minor into connexion with the
middle term; and this is also the reason why Aristotle recognises
three syllogistic figures only, instead of the four admitted
by later logicians. For, the middle may either be
contained in one extreme and contain the other, which gives
us the first figure; or it may contain both, which gives the
second figure; or be contained in both, which gives the
third; and this is an exhaustive enumeration of the possible
combinations.<a id="FNanchor_274_274" href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">274</a></p>

<p>We have here, also, the secret of that elaborate machinery
devised for the very unnecessary purpose of converting syllogisms
of the second and third figure into syllogisms of the first,
which is one of the Stagirite’s principal contributions to logic.
For it is only in the first figure that the notion by which the
extremes are either united or held apart is really a middle
term, that is to say, really comes between the others. The
distinction between perfect and imperfect syllogisms also
serves to illustrate Aristotle’s systematic division between
the necessary and the contingent. The method of proof by
inclusion corresponds in its unconditioned and independent
validity to the concentric arrangement of the supernal spheres;
the second and third figures, with their conversions and reductions,
to the sublunary sphere in its helpless dependence on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
the celestial revolutions, and its transformations of the elements
into one another.</p>

<p>The rules which Aristotle gives us for the conversion of
propositions are no doubt highly instructive, and throw great
light on their meaning; but one cannot help observing that
such a process as conversion ought, on his own principles, to
have been inadmissible. With Plato, the copulation of subject
and predicate corresponded to an almost mechanical
juxtaposition of two self-existent ideas. It was, therefore, a
matter of indifference in what order they were placed. Aristotle,
on the other hand, after insisting on the restoration of
the concrete object, and reducing general notions to an
analysis of its particular aspects, could not but make the predicate
subordinate to, and dependent on, the subject—a relation
which altogether excludes the logical possibility of
making them interchangeable with one another.<a id="FNanchor_275_275" href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">275</a></p>

<p>The antithetical structure of the whole system is reproduced
even in the first syllogistic figure, where there is a
similar opposition between the first mood, by which alone
universal affirmatives can be obtained, and the remaining three,
whose conclusions are either negative or particular, or both.
And the complicated rules for testing the validity of those
syllogisms in which the premises are distinguished as necessary,
actual, and possible, are still more obviously based on
Aristotle’s false metaphysical distinctions; so that with the
overthrow of those distinctions large portions of the <cite>Analytics</cite>
lose their entire value for modern students.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a theory of reasoning based on the
relations of concepts, instead of on the relations of judgments,
necessarily leaves out of account the whole doctrine of hypothetical
and disjunctive propositions, together with that of
the syllogisms based on them; since the elements of which
they are composed are themselves propositions. And this
inevitable omission is the more remarkable because alterna<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>tive
and, to a less extent, hypothetical arguments form the
staple of Aristotle’s own dialectic; while categorical reasoning
never occurs in it at all. His constant method is to enumerate
all possible views of a subject, and examine them one after
the other, rejecting those which are untenable, and resting
content with the remainder. In other words, he reaches his
positive conclusions through a series of negative premises
representing a process of gradual elimination. The <cite>First
Analytics</cite> is itself an admirable instance of his favourite
method. Every possible combination of terms is discussed,
and the valid moods are sifted out from a much greater
number of illegitimate syllogisms. The dialectic of Socrates
and Plato followed the same procedure. It was essentially
experimental—a method of trial, elimination, and selection.
On going back still further, we find that when there is any
reasoning at all in Homer, it is conducted after the same
fashion. Hector, in his soliloquy before the Scaean Gate,
imagines three alternative courses, together exhausting the
possibilities of the situation. He may either retreat within
the walls, or offer terms of peace to Achilles, or fight. The
first two alternatives being rejected, nothing remains but the
third. This is the most elaborate example; but on many
other occasions Homer’s actors are represented as hesitating
between two courses, and finally deciding on one of them.</p>

<p>Disjunction is, in truth, the primordial form of all reasoning,
out of which the other forms are successively evolved;
and, as such, it is common to man with the lower animals.
You are taking a walk in the country with your dog. You
come to a stream and jump over it. On measuring the
distance with his eye, the animal is afraid to follow you.
After waiting a little, he first runs up stream in search of a
crossing, and, finding none, returns to look for one in the opposite
direction. Failing there also, he comes back once more, and
either ventures on the leap or makes his way home by some
other route. Now, on considering the matter a little more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
closely, we shall find that hypothetical reasoning takes its rise
from the examination of each separate alternative presented
by a disjunctive premise. A plurality of courses being open
to us, we consider what will ensue on the acceptance or rejection
of each. The dog in our illustration thinks (after a
canine fashion) that if he jumps he may fall in; if he does not,
he will be left behind. Hector will not take refuge within the
walls, because, if he does, Polydamas will triumph over him;
nor will he offer terms of peace, because, if he does, Achilles
will refuse them. Once more, categorical reasoning is developed
out of hypothetical reasoning by the necessity of
deducing consequences from a general rule. Hector must
have argued from the known characters of Polydamas and
Achilles, that in certain circumstances they would act after a
certain manner. We may add, that this progress of conscious
reasoning is a reproduction of the unconscious logic according
to which life itself is evolved. All sorts of combinations are
spontaneously produced, which, in consequence of the struggle
for existence, cannot all survive. Those adapted to the conditions
of life are selected, on trial, at the expense of the rest;
and their adaptation or non-adaptation is determined in
accordance with categorical laws. Furthermore, the framing
of a disjunctive proposition necessitates the systematic
distribution of possibilities under mutually exclusive heads,
thus involving the logical processes of definition, division, and
classification. Dialectic, as Plato understood it, consisted
almost entirely in the joint performance of these operations;—a
process which Aristotle regards as the immediate but
very imperfect precursor of his own syllogistic method.<a id="FNanchor_276_276" href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">276</a> You
cannot, he says, prove anything by dividing, for instance, all
living things into the two classes, mortal and immortal; unless,
indeed, you assume the very point under discussion—to
which class a particular species belongs. Yet this is how he
constantly reasons himself; and even demonstrative reason<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>ing,
as he interprets it, implies the possession of a ready-made
classification. For, according to him, it consists exclusively
of propositions which predicate some essential attribute of
a thing—in other words, some attribute already included in
the definition of the subject; and a continuous series of
such definitions can only be given by a fixed classification of
things.</p>


<h3><a id="VII-VII"></a>VII.</h3>

<p>We have endeavoured to show that Aristotle’s account of
the syllogism is redundant on the one side and defective on
the other, both errors being due to a false analysis of the
reasoning process itself, combined with a false metaphysical
philosophy. The same evil influences tell with much greater
effect on his theory of applied reasoning. Here the fundamental
division, corresponding to that between heaven and earth in
the cosmos, is between demonstration and dialectic or experimental
reasoning. The one starts with first principles of
unquestionable validity, the other with principles the validity
of which is to be tested by their consequences. Stated in its
most abstract form, the distinction is sound, and very nearly
prefigures the modern division between deduction and induction,
the process by which general laws are applied, and
the process by which they are established. Aristotle,
however, committed two great mistakes; he thought that
each method corresponded to an entirely different order of
phenomena: and he thought that both were concerned for
the most part with definitions. The <cite>Posterior Analytics</cite>, which
contains his theory of demonstration, answers to the astronomical
portion of his physics; it is the doctrine of eternal
and necessary truth. And just as his ontology distinguishes
between the Prime Mover himself unmoved and the eternal
movement produced by his influence, so also his logic distinguishes
between infallible first principles and the truths
derived from them, the latter being, in his opinion, of inferior<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
value. Now, according to Aristotle, these first principles are
definitions, and it is to this fact that their self-evident certainty
is due. At the same time they are not verbal but real definitions—that
is to say, the universal forms of things in themselves
as made manifest to the eye of reason, or rather,
stamped upon it like the impression of a signet-ring on wax.
And, by a further refinement, he seems to distinguish between
the concept as a whole and the separate marks which make
it up, these last being the ultimate elements of all existence,
and as much beyond its complex forms as Nous is beyond
reasoned truth.</p>

<p>Such a view was essentially unfavourable to the progress
of science, assigning, as it did, a higher dignity to meagre and
very questionable abstractions than to the far-reaching combinations
by which alone we are enabled to unravel the inmost
texture of visible phenomena. Instead of using reason to
supplement sense, Aristotle turned it into a more subtle and
universal kind of sense; and if this disastrous assimilation
was to a certain extent imposed upon him by the traditions
of Athenian thought, it harmonised admirably with the descriptive
and superficial character of his own intelligence.
Much was also due to the method of geometry, which in his
time had already assumed the form made familiar to us by
Euclid’s <cite>Elements</cite>. The employment of axioms side by side
with definitions, might, indeed, have drawn his attention to
the existence and importance of judgments which, in Kantian
terminology, are not analytic but synthetic—that is, which
add to the content of a notion instead of simply analysing it.
But although he mentions axioms, and states that mathematical
theorems are deduced from them, no suspicion of their essential
difference from definitions, or of the typical significance
which they were destined to assume in the theory of reasoning,
seems ever to have crossed his mind; otherwise he could
hardly have failed to ask how we come by our knowledge of
them, and to what they correspond in Nature. On the whole,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
it seems likely that he looked on them as an analysis of our
ideas, differing only from definition proper by the generality
of its application; for he names the law of contradiction
as the most important of all axioms, and that from
which the others proceed;<a id="FNanchor_277_277" href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> next to it he places the law of
excluded middle, which is also analytical; and his only other
example is, that if equals be taken from equals the remainders
are equal, a judgment the synthetic character of which
is by no means clear, and has occasionally been disputed.<a id="FNanchor_278_278" href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">278</a></p>

<p>We cannot, then, agree with those critics who attribute to
Aristotle a recognition of such things as ‘laws of nature,’ in
the sense of uniform co-existences and sequences.<a id="FNanchor_279_279" href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">279</a> Such an
idea implies a certain balance and equality between subject
and predicate which he would never have admitted. It would,
in his own language, be making relation, instead of substance,
the leading category. It must be remembered also that he
did not acknowledge the existence of those constant conjunctions
in Nature which we call laws. He did not admit that
all matter was heavy, or that fluidity implied the presence of
heat. The possession of constant properties, or rather of a
single constant property—circular rotation—is reserved for
the aether. Nor is this a common property of different and
indefinitely multipliable phenomena; it characterises a single
body, measurable in extent and unique in kind. Moreover,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
we have something better than indirect evidence on this
point; we have the plain statement of Aristotle himself, that
all science depends on first principles, about which it is impossible
to be mistaken, precisely because they are universal
abstractions not presented to the mind by any combination,<a id="FNanchor_280_280" href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">280</a>—a
view quite inconsistent with the priority now given
to general laws.</p>

<p>Answering to the first principles of demonstration in logic,
if not absolutely identical with them, are what Aristotle calls
causes in the nature of things. We have seen what an important
part the middle term plays in Aristotle’s theory of the
syllogism. It is the vital principle of demonstration, the connecting
link by which the two extreme terms are attached to
one another. In the theory of applied logic, whose object is
to bring the order of thought into complete parallelism with
the order of things, the middle term through which a fact is
demonstrated answers to the cause through which it exists.
According to our notions, only two terms, antecedent and
consequent, are involved in the idea of causation; and causation
only becomes a matter for reasoning when we perceive
that the sequence is repeated in a uniform manner. But
Aristotle was very far from having reached, or even suspected,
this point of view. A cause is with him not a determining
antecedent, but a secret nexus by which the co-existence of
two phenomena is explained. Instead of preceding it intercedes;
and this is why he finds its subjective counterpart in
the middle term of the syllogism. Some of his own examples
will make the matter clearer. Why is the moon eclipsed?
Because the earth intervenes between her and the sun. Why
is the bright side of the moon always turned towards the sun?
Because she shines by his reflected light (here light is the
middle term). Why is that person talking to the rich man?
Because he wants to borrow money of him. Why are those
two men friends? Because they have the same enemy.<a id="FNanchor_281_281" href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">281</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span></p>

<p>Aristotle even goes so far as to eliminate the notion of
sequence from causation altogether. He tells us that the
causes of events are contemporary with the events themselves;
those of past events being past; of present events, present;
and of future events, future. ‘This thing will not be because
that other thing has happened, for the middle term must be
homogeneous with the extremes.’<a id="FNanchor_282_282" href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">282</a> It is obvious that such a
limitation abolishes the power of scientific prediction, which,
if not the only test of knowledge, is at any rate its most valuable
verification. The Stagirite has been charged with trusting
too much to deductive reasoning; it now appears that, on
the contrary, he had no conception of its most important
function. Here, as everywhere, he follows not the synthetic
method of the mathematician, but the analytic method of the
naturalist. Finally, instead of combining the notions of cause
and kind, he systematically confuses them. It will be
remembered how his excellent division of causes into material,
formal, efficient, and final, was rendered nugatory by the
continued influence of Plato’s ideas. The formal cause always
tended to absorb the other three; and it is by their complete
assimilation that he attempts to harmonise the order of
demonstration with the order of existence. For the formal
cause of a phenomenon simply meant those properties which
it shared with others of the same kind, and it was by virtue of
those properties that it became a subject for general reasoning,
which was interpreted as a methodical arrangement of
concepts one within another, answering to the concentric disposition
of the cosmic spheres.</p>

<p>Owing to the slight importance which Aristotle attaches
to judgments as compared with concepts, he does not go
very deeply into the question, how do we obtain our premises?
He says, in remarkably emphatic language, that all knowledge
is acquired either by demonstration or by induction; or rather,
we may add, in the last resort by the latter only, since demon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>stration
rests on generals which are discovered inductively;
but his generals mean definitions and abstract predicates or
subjects, rather than synthetic propositions. If, however, his
attention had been called to the distinction, we cannot suppose
that he would, on his own principles, have adopted conclusions
essentially different from those of the modern experiential
school. Mr. Wallace does, indeed, claim him as a supporter
of the theory that no inference can be made from particulars
to particulars without the aid of a general proposition, and as
having refuted, by anticipation, Mill’s assertion to the contrary.
We quote the analysis which is supposed to prove this in Mr.
Wallace’s own words:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We reason that because the war between Thebes and Phocis was
a war between neighbours and an evil, therefore the war between
Athens and Thebes, being also a war between neighbours, will in
all probability be also an evil. Thus, out of the one parallel case—the
war between Thebes and Phocis—we form the <em>general</em> proposition,
All wars between neighbours are evils; to this we add the
minor, the war between Athens and Thebes is a war between neighbours—and
thence arrive at the conclusion that the war between
Athens and Thebes will be likewise an evil.<a id="FNanchor_283_283" href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">283</a></p></blockquote>

<p>On the strength of this Mr. Wallace elsewhere observes:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>His [Aristotle’s] theory of syllogism is simply an explicit statement
of the fact that all knowledge, all thought, rests on universal
truths or general propositions—that all knowledge, whether ‘deductive’
or ‘inductive,’ is arrived at by the aid, the indispensable aid,
of general propositions. We in England have been almost charmed
into the belief that reasoning is perpetually from particular to particular,
and a ‘village matron’ and her ‘Lucy’ have been used to
express the truth for us in the concrete form adapted to our weaker
comprehension (Mill’s <cite>Logic</cite>, bk. ii. ch. 3). We shall next be told,
forsooth, that oxygen and hydrogen do not enter into the composition
of water, because our village matron ‘perpetually’ drinks it
without ‘passing through’ either element, and the analysis of the
chemist will be proved as great a fiction as the analysis of the logician.
Aristotle has supplied the links which at once upset all such superficial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
analysis. He has shown that even in analogy or example, which
<em>apparently</em> proceeds in this way from one particular instance to
another particular instance, we are only justified in so proceeding in
so far as we have transformed the particular instance into a general
proposition.<a id="FNanchor_284_284" href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">284</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Now, there is this great difference between Aristotle and
Mill, that the former is only showing how reasoning from
examples can be set forth in syllogistic form, while the latter
is investigating the psychological process which underlies all
reasoning, and the real foundation on which a valid inference
rests—questions which had never presented themselves clearly
to the mind of the Greek philosopher at all. Mill argues, in
the first instance, that when any particular proposition is
deduced from a general proposition, it is proved by the same
evidence as that on which the general itself rests, namely, on
other particulars; and, so far, he is in perfect agreement with
Aristotle. He then argues that inferences from particulars to
particulars are perpetually made without passing through a
general proposition: and, to illustrate his meaning, he quotes
the example of a ‘village matron and her Lucy,’ to which Mr.
Wallace refers with a very gratuitous sneer.<a id="FNanchor_285_285" href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">285</a></p>

<p>However, as we have seen, he is not above turning it
against Mill. The drift of his own illustration is not very
clear, but we suppose it implies that the matron unconsciously
frames the general proposition: My remedy is good
for all children suffering from the same disease as Lucy; and
with equal unconsciousness reasons down from this to the case
of her neighbour’s child. Now, it is quite unjustifiable to call
Mill’s analysis superficial because it leaves out of account a
hypothesis incompatible with the nominalism which Mill
professed. It is still more unjustifiable to quote against it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
the authority of a philosopher who perfectly agreed with those
who disbelieve in the possibility of unconscious knowledge,<a id="FNanchor_286_286" href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">286</a>
and contemptuously rejected Plato’s opinion to the contrary.
Nor is this all. The doctrine that reasoning is from particulars
to particulars, even when it passes through general
propositions, may be rigorously deduced from Aristotle’s own
admissions. If nothing exists but particulars, and if knowledge
is of what exists, then all knowledge is of particulars.
Therefore, if the propositions entering into a chain of reasoning
are knowledge, they must deal with particulars exclusively.
And, quite apart from the later developments of Aristotle’s
philosophy, we have his express assertion, that all generals
are derived from particulars, which is absolutely incompatible
with the alleged fact, that ‘all knowledge, all thought, rests on
universal truths, on general propositions; that all knowledge,
whether “deductive” or “inductive,” is arrived at by the aid,
the indispensable aid, of general propositions.’ To Aristotle
the basis of knowledge was not ‘truths’ of any kind, but
concepts; and in the last chapter of the <cite>Posterior Analytics</cite>
he has explained how these concepts are derived from sense-perceptions
without the aid of any ‘propositions’ whatever.</p>

<p>We are here confronted with an important and much disputed
question, Was Aristotle an empiricist? We hold most
decidedly that he was, if by empiricist is meant, what alone
should be meant—one who believes that the mind neither
anticipates anything in the content, nor contributes anything
to the form of experience; in other words, who believes
knowledge to be the agreement of thought with things
imposed by things on thought. We have already shown,
when discussing Sir A. Grant’s view to the contrary, that
Aristotle was in no sense a transcendental idealist. The other
half of our position is proved by the chapter in the <cite>Posterior
Analytics</cite> already referred to, the language of which is <i lang="la">primâ
facie</i> so much in favour of our view that the burden of proof<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
rests on those who give it another interpretation. Among
these, the latest with whom we are acquainted is Zeller. The
eminent German historian, after asserting in former editions
of his work that Aristotle derived his first principles from the
self-contemplation of the Nous, has now, probably in deference
to the unanswerable arguments of Kampe, abandoned this
position. He still, however, assumes the existence of a rather
indefinable <i lang="la">à priori</i> element in the Aristotelian noology, on
the strength of the following considerations:—In the first
place, according to Aristotle, even sense-perception is not a
purely passive process, and therefore intellectual cognition
can still less be so (p. 190). But the passages quoted only
amount to this, that the passivity of a thing which is raised
from possibility to actuality differs from the passivity implied
in the destruction of its proper nature; and that the objects
of abstract thought come from within, not from without, in
the sense that they are presented by the imagination to the
reason. The pure empiricist need not deny either position.
He would freely admit that to lose one’s reason through
drunkenness or disease is a quite different sort of operation
from being impressed with a new truth; and he would also
admit that we generalise not directly from outward experience,
but from that highly-abridged and representative experience
which memory supplies. Neither process, however,
constitutes an anticipation of outward experience or an addition
to it. It is from the materialist, not from the empiricist,
that Aristotle differs. He believes that the forms under
which matter appears are separable from every particular
portion of matter, though not from all matter, in the external
world; and he believes that a complete separation between
them is effected in the single instance of self-conscious reason,
which again, in cognising any particular thing is identified with
that thing <em>minus</em> its matter. Zeller’s next argument is that the
cognition of ideas by the Nous is immediate, whereas the process
of generalisation from experience described by Aristotle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
is extremely indirect. Here Zeller seems to misunderstand
the word ἄμεσος. Aristotle never applies it to knowledge, but
only to the objective relations of ideas with one another.
Two terms constitute an ‘immediate’ premise when they are
not connected by another term, quite irrespective of the steps
by which we come to recognise their conjunction. So with
the terms themselves. They are ‘immediate’ when they
cannot be derived from any ulterior principle; when, in short,
they are simple and uncaused. Finally, the objection that
first principles, being the most certain and necessary of any,
cannot be derived from sensible experience, which, dealing
only with material objects, must inherit the uncertainty and
contingency of matter,—is an objection, not to the empiricist
interpretation of Aristotle’s philosophy, but to empiricism
itself; and it is not allowable to explain away the plain words
of an ancient writer in order to reconcile them with assumptions
which he nowhere admits. That universality and
necessity involve an <i lang="la">à priori</i> cognition or an intellectual
intuition, is a modern theory unsupported by a single sentence
in Aristotle.<a id="FNanchor_287_287" href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">287</a> We quite agree with Zeller when he goes on
to say that in Aristotle’s psychology ‘certain thoughts and
notions arise through the action of the object thought about
on the thinking mind, just as perception arises through the
action of the perceived object on the percipient’ (p. 195); but
how this differs from the purest empiricism is more than we
are able to understand.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that Aristotle, after repeatedly speaking
of induction as an ascent from particulars to generals, when
he comes to trace the process by which we arrive at the most
general notions of any, does not admit the possibility of such
a movement in one direction only. The universal and the
individual are, according to him, combined in our most
elementary sense-impressions, and the business of scientific<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
experience is to separate them. Starting from a middle
point, we work up to indivisible predicates on the one hand
and down to indivisible subjects on the other, the final apprehension
of both extremes being the office, not of science, but of
Nous. This theory is equally true and acute. The perception
of individual facts is just as difficult and just as slowly acquired
as the conception of ultimate abstractions. Moreover,
the two processes are carried on <i lang="la">pari passu</i>, each being only
made possible by and through the other. No true notion
can be framed without a firm grasp of the particulars from
which it is abstracted; no individual object can be studied
without analysing it into a group of common predicates, the
idiosyncrasy of which—that is, their special combination—differentiates
it from every other object. What, however, we
wish to remark is the illustration incidentally afforded by
this striking aperçu of Aristotle’s analytical method, which is
also the essentially Greek method of thought. We saw that,
for our philosopher, syllogism was not the subsumption of a
particular case under a general law, but the interpolation of a
mean between two extremes; we now see that his induction
is not the finding of a law for the particular phenomenon, but
its analysis into two elements—one universal and the other
individual—a solution of the mean into the extremes. And
the distinctive originality of his whole system was to fix two
such extremes for the universe—a self-thinking thought in
absolute self-identity at one end of the scale, and an absolutely
indeterminate matter at the other; by combining
which in various proportions he then re-constructed the
whole intermediate phenomenal reality. In studying each
particular class of facts, he follows the same method. The
genus is marked by some characteristic attribute which one
species—the prerogative species, so to speak—exhibits in
its greatest purity, while the others form a graduated scale
by variously combining this attribute with its opposite or
privation. Hence his theory, since revived by Goethe, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
the colours are so many different mixtures of light and
darkness.</p>

<p>It has, until lately, been customary to speak as if all that
Aristotle knew about induction was contained in a few
scattered passages where it is mentioned under that name in
the <cite>Analytics</cite>. This, no doubt, is true, if by induction we
mean simple generalisation. But if we understand by it the
philosophy of experimental evidence—the analysis of those
means by which, in the absence of direct observation, we
decide between two conflicting hypotheses—then the <cite>Topics</cite>
must be pronounced as good a discussion on the subject as
was compatible with his general theory of knowledge. For
he supposes that there are large classes of phenomena, including,
among other things, the whole range of human life, which,
not being bound by any fixed order, lie outside the scope of
scientific demonstration, although capable of being determined
with various degrees of probability; and here also what he
has in view is not the discovery of laws, but the construction
of definitions. These being a matter of opinion, could always
be attacked as well as maintained. Thus the constant conflict
and balancing of opposite forces, which we have learned
to associate with the sublunary sphere, has its logical representative
no less than the kindred ideas of uncertainty and
vicissitude. And, in connexion with this side of applied
logic, Aristotle has also to consider the requirements of those
who took part in the public debates on disputed questions,
then very common among educated Athenians, and frequently
turning on verbal definitions. Hence, while we find many
varieties of reasoning suggested, such as Reasoning by
Analogy, Disjunctive Reasoning, Hypothetical Reasoning
(though without a generalised expression for all its varieties),
and, what is most remarkable, three out of Mill’s four Experimental
Methods,<a id="FNanchor_288_288" href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">288</a> we do not find that any interesting or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
useful application is made of them. Even considered as a
handbook for debaters, the <cite>Topics</cite> is not successful. With
the practical incompetence of a mere naturalist, Aristotle has
supplied heads for arguments in such profusion and such
utter carelessness of their relative importance that no memory
could sustain the burden, except in the probably rare instances
when a lifetime was devoted to their study.</p>


<h3><a id="VII-VIII"></a>VIII.</h3>

<p>We have now concluded our survey of the first great
mental antithesis, that between reason on the one hand, and
sense and opinion on the other. The next antithesis, that
between reason and passion, will occupy us a much shorter
time. With it we pass from theory to practice, from metaphysics
and logic to moral philosophy. But, as we saw in
the preceding chapter, Aristotle is not a practical genius;
for him the supreme interest of life is still the acquisition of
knowledge. Theorising activity corresponds to the celestial
world, in which there can be neither opposition nor excess;
while passion corresponds to the sublunary sphere, where
order is only preserved by the balancing of antithetical forces;
and the moderating influence of reason, to the control exercised
by the higher over the lower system.</p>

<p>The passions themselves, and the means by which they
can be either excited or controlled, are described in Aristotle’s
<cite>Rhetoric</cite> with wonderful knowledge of human nature in the
abstract, but with almost no reference to the art for whose
purposes the information is ostensibly systematised; while in
the <cite>Ethics</cite> they are studied, so to speak, statically, in their
condition of permanent equilibration or disequilibration; the
virtues and vices being represented as so many different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
aspects of those conditions. It is obvious that such an extremely
artificial parallelism could not be carried out without
a considerable strain and distortion of the facts involved. The
only virtue that can, with truth, be described as a form of
moderation is temperance; and even in temperance this is
accidental rather than essential. Elsewhere Aristotle deduces
the extremes from the mean rather than the mean from the
extremes; and sometimes one of the extremes is invented
for the occasion. To fit justice, confessedly the most important
virtue, into such a scheme, was obviously impracticable
without reinterpreting the idea of moderation. Instead of an
equilibrium between opposing impulses in the same person,
we have equality in the treatment of different persons; which
again resolves itself into giving them their own, without any
definite determination of what their own may be.<a id="FNanchor_289_289" href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">289</a> It cannot
even be said that Aristotle represented either the best ethical
thought of his own age, or an indispensable stage in the
evolution of all thought. The extreme insufficiency of his
ethical theory is due to the fancied necessity of squaring it
with the requirements of his cosmological system. For no
sooner does he place himself at the popular point of view
than he deduces the particular virtues from regard to the
welfare of others, and treats them all as so many different
forms of justice.<a id="FNanchor_290_290" href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">290</a></p>

<p>Aristotle has sometimes been represented as an advocate
of free-will against necessity. But the question had not really
been opened in his time. He rejected fatalism; but it had
not occurred to him that internal motives might exercise a
constraining power over action. Nor has his freedom anything
to do with the self-assertion of mind, its extrication from the
chain of physical antecedents. It is simply the element of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
arbitrariness and uncertainty supposed to characterise the
region of change and opposition, as distinguished from the
higher region of undeviating regularity.</p>

<p>It is only in this higher region that perfect virtue can be
realised. The maintenance of a settled balance between rival
solicitations, or between the excess and defect of those impulses
which lead us to seek pleasure and avoid pain, is good
indeed, but neither the only nor the chief good. The law of
moderation does not extend to that supremely happy life
which is related to our emotional existence as the aether to
the terrestrial elements, as soul to body, as reason to sense,
as science to opinion. Here it is the steady subordination of
means to ends which imitates the insphering of the heavenly
orbs, the hierarchy of psychic faculties, and the chain of syllogistic
arguments. Of theoretic activity we cannot have too
much, and all other activities, whether public or private,
should be regarded as so much machinery for ensuring its
peaceful prosecution. Wisdom and temperance had been
absolutely identified by Socrates; they are as absolutely
held apart by Aristotle. And what we have had occasion to
observe in the other departments of thought is verified here
once more. The method of analysis and opposition, apparently
so prudent, proved, in the end, unfruitful. Notwithstanding
his paradoxes, Socrates was substantially right.
The moral regeneration of the world was destined to be
brought about, not by Dorian discipline, but by free Athenian
thought, working on practical conceptions—by the discovery
of new moral truth, or rather by the dialectic development
of old truth. And, conversely, the highest development
of theoretic activity was not attained by isolating it in
egoistic self-contemplation from the world of human needs,
but by consecrating it to their service, informing it with their
vitality, and subjecting it, in common with them, to that law of
moderation from which no energy, however godlike, is exempt.</p>

<p>The final antithesis of conscious life is that between the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
individual and the state. In this sense, Aristotle’s <cite>Politics</cite> is
the completion of his <cite>Ethics</cite>. It is only in a well-ordered
community that moral habits can be acquired; and it is only
in such a community that the best or intellectual life can be
attained, although, properly speaking, it is not a social life.
Nevertheless, the <cite>Politics</cite>, like every other portion of Aristotle’s
system, reproduces within itself the elements of an independent
whole. To understand its internal organisation, we
must begin by disregarding Aristotle’s abortive classification
(chiefly adapted from Plato) of constitutions into three legitimate—Monarchy,
Aristocracy, and Republic; and three
illegitimate—Democracy, Oligarchy, and Tyranny. Aristotle
distinguishes them by saying that the legitimate forms are
governed with a view to the general good; the illegitimate
with a view to the interests of particular classes or persons.
But, in point of fact, as Zeller shows,<a id="FNanchor_291_291" href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">291</a> he cannot keep up this
distinction; and we shall better understand his true idea by
substituting for it another—that between the intellectual and
the material state. The object of the one is to secure the
highest culture for a ruling caste, who are to abstain from industrial
occupations, and to be supported by the labour of a
dependent population. Such a government may be either
monarchical or aristocratic; but it must necessarily be in the
hands of a few. The object of the other is to maintain a
stable equilibrium between the opposing interests of rich and
poor—two classes practically distinguished as the few and the
many. This end is best attained where supreme power
belongs to the middle class. The deviations are represented
by oligarchy and tyranny on the one side, and by extreme
democracy on the other. Where such constitutions exist, the
best mode of preserving them is to moderate their characteristic
excess by borrowing certain institutions from the opposite
form of government, or by modifying their own institutions
in a conciliatory sense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span></p>

<p>In the last chapter we dealt at length with the theories of
art, and especially of tragic poetry, propounded in Aristotle’s
<cite>Poetics</cite>. For the sake of formal completeness, it may be
mentioned here that those theories are adapted to the general
scheme of his systematic philosophy. The plot or plan of a
work answers to the formal or rational element in Nature, and
this is why Aristotle so immensely over-estimates its importance.
And, just as in his moral philosophy, the ethical element,
represented by character-drawing, is strictly subordinated
to it. The centre of equilibrium is, however, not supplied
by virtue, but by exact imitation of Nature, so that the
characters must not deviate very far from mediocrity in the
direction either of heroism or of wickedness.</p>


<h3><a id="VII-IX"></a>IX.</h3>

<p>Notwithstanding the radical error of Aristotle’s philosophy—the
false abstraction and isolation of the intellectual from
the material sphere in Nature and in human life—it may furnish
a useful corrective to the much falser philosophy insinuated,
if not inculcated, by some moralists of our own age and
country. Taken altogether, the teaching of these writers
seems to be that the industry which addresses itself to the
satisfaction of our material wants is much more meritorious
than the artistic work which gives us direct aesthetic enjoyment,
or the literary work which stimulates and gratifies our
intellectual cravings; while within the artistic sphere fidelity
of portraiture is preferred to the creation of ideal beauty;
and within the intellectual sphere, mere observation of facts
is set above the theorising power by which facts are unified
and explained. Some of the school to whom we allude are
great enemies of materialism; but teaching like theirs is
materialism of the worst description. Consistently carried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>
out, it would first reduce Europe to the level of China, and then
reduce the whole human race to the level of bees or beavers.
They forget that when we were all comfortably clothed,
housed, and fed, our true lives would have only just begun.
The choice would then remain between some new refinement
of animal appetite and the theorising activity which, according
to Aristotle, is the absolute end, every other activity
being only a means for its attainment. There is not, indeed,
such a fundamental distinction as he supposed, for activities
of every order are connected by a continual reciprocity of
services; but this only amounts to saying that the highest
knowledge is a means to every other end no less than an end
in itself. Aristotle is also fully justified in urging the necessity
of leisure as a condition of intellectual progress. We
may add that it is a leisure which is amply earned, for without
it industrial production could not be maintained at its present
height. Nor should the same standard of perfection be
imposed on spiritual as on material labour. The latter could
not be carried on at all unless success, and not failure, were
the rule. It is otherwise in the ideal sphere. There the
proportions are necessarily reversed. We must be content if
out of a thousand guesses and trials one should contribute
something to the immortal heritage of truth. Yet we may
hope that this will not always be so, that the great discoveries
and creations wrought out through the waste of innumerable
lives are not only the expiation of all error and suffering in
the past, but are also the pledge of a future when such sacrifices
shall no longer be required.</p>

<p>The two elements of error and achievement are so intimately
blended and mutually conditioned in the philosophy
which we have been reviewing, that to decide on their respective
importance is impossible without first deciding on a still
larger question—the value of systematic thought as such, and
apart from its actual content. For Aristotle was perhaps the
greatest master of systematisation that ever lived. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
framework and language of science are still, to a great extent,
what he made them; and it remains to be seen whether they
will ever be completely remodelled. Yet even this gift has
not been an unmixed benefit, for it was long used in the
service of false doctrines, and it still induces critics to read
into the Aristotelian forms truths which they do not really
contain. Let us conclude by observing that of all the ancients,
or even of all thinkers before the eighteenth century, there is
none to whom the methods and results of modern science
could so easily be explained. While finding that they
reversed his own most cherished convictions on every point,
he would still be prepared by his logical studies to appreciate
the evidence on which they rest, and by his ardent love of
truth to accept them without reserve. Most of all would he
welcome our astronomy and our biology with wonder and
delight, while viewing the development of modern machinery
with much more qualified admiration, and the progress of
democracy perhaps with suspicious fear. He who thought
that the mind and body of an artisan were alike debased by
the exercise of some simple handicraft under the pure bright
sky of Greece, what would he have said to the effect wrought
on human beings by the noisome, grinding, sunless, soulless
drudgery of our factories and mines! How profoundly unfitted
would he have deemed its victims to influence those political
issues with which the interests of science are every day
becoming more vitally connected! Yet slowly, perhaps, and
unwillingly, he might be brought to perceive that our industry
has been the indispensable basis of our knowledge, as supplying
both the material means and the moral ends of its
cultivation. He might also learn that there is an even closer
relationship between the two: that while the supporters of
privilege are leagued for the maintenance of superstition, the
workers, and those who advocate their claims to political
equality, are leagued for its restraint and overthrow. And if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
he still shrank back from the heat and smoke and turmoil
amid which the genius of our age stands, like another Heracleitus,
in feverish excitement, by the steam-furnace whence
its powers of revolutionary transmutation are derived, we
too might reapply the words of the old Ephesian prophet,
bidding him enter boldly, for here also there are gods.</p>

The tendency which it has been attempted to characterise as a fundamental
moment of Greek thought can only be called analytical in default of a better word.
It is a process by which two related terms are at once parted and joined together
by the insertion of one or more intermediary links; as, for instance, when a
capital is inserted between column and architrave, or when a proposition is demonstrated
by the interposition of a middle term between its subject and predicate.
The German words Vermitteln and Vermittelung express what is meant
with sufficient exactitude. They play a great part in Hegel’s philosophy, and it
will be remembered that Hegel was the most Hellenic of modern thinkers. So
understood, there will cease to be any contradiction between the Eleates and
Greek thought generally, at least from one point of view, as their object was to
fill up the vacant spaces supposed to separate one mode of existence from another.</p></div>

Since the above remarks were first published, Mr. Wallace, in his work on
Epicureanism, has stated that, according to Epicurus, ‘the very animals which are
found upon the earth have been made what they are by slow processes of selection
and adaptation through the experience of life;’ and he proceeds to call the theory
in question, ‘ultra-Darwinian’ (<cite>Epicureanism</cite>, p. 114). Lucretius—the authority
quoted—says nothing about ‘slow processes of adaptation,’ nor yet does he say
that the animals were ‘made what they are’ by ‘selection,’ but by the procreative
power of the earth herself. Picking out a ready-made pair of boots from among a
number which do not fit is a very different process from manufacturing the same
pair by measure, or wearing it into shape. To call the Empedoclean theory
ultra-Darwinian, is like calling the Democritean or Epicurean theory of gravitation
ultra-Newtonian. And Mr. Wallace seems to admit as much, when he proceeds
to say on the very same page, ‘Of course in this there is no implication of
the peculiarly Darwinian doctrine of descent or development of kind from kind
with structure modified and complicated to meet changing circumstances.’ (By
the way, this is <cite>not</cite> a peculiarly Darwinian doctrine, for it originated with
Lamarck, spontaneous variation and selection being the additions made by the
English naturalists). But what becomes then of the ‘slow processes of adaptation’
and the ‘ultra-Darwinian theory’ spoken of just before?</p></div>

By a curious coincidence, the atomic constitution of matter still finds its
strongest proof in optical phenomena. Light is propagated by transverse waves,
and such waves are only possible in a discontinuous medium. But if the luminiferous
ether is composed of discrete particles, so also must be the matter which it
penetrates in all directions.</p></div>

A creditor asks Strepsiades, who has been taking lessons in philosophy, to pay

(οὐ γὰρ δίκαιον πλείον εἶναι). ‘Then, you wretch,’ rejoins his debtor, ‘do you

it, and that your money is to go on increasing?’ (1290-95.)</p></div>

It may possibly be asked, Why, if Plato gave only an ideal picture of
Socrates, are we to accept his versions of the Sophistic teaching as literally exact?
The answer is that he was compelled, by the nature of the case, to create an
imaginary Socrates, while he could have no conceivable object in ascribing views
which he did not himself hold to well-known historical personages. Assuming
an unlimited right of making fictitious statements for the public good, his principles
would surely not have permitted him wantonly to calumniate his innocent
contemporaries by foisting on them odious theories for which they were not
responsible. Had nobody held such opinions as those attributed to Thrasymachus
in the <cite>Republic</cite> there would have been no object in attacking them; and
if anybody held them, why not Thrasymachus as well as another? With regard
to the veracity of the <cite>Apologia</cite>, Grote, in his work on Plato (I. 291), quotes a
passage from Aristeides the rhetor, stating that all the companions of Socrates
agreed about the Delphic oracle, and the Socratic disclaimer of knowledge. This,
however, proves too much, for it shows that Aristeides quite overlooked the
absence of any reference to either point in Xenophon, and therefore cannot be
trusted to give an accurate report of the other authorities.</p></div>

We think, however, that Mr. Edwin Wallace has overstated the case, when
he makes Aristotle say that ‘democracy is not unlikely with the spread of population
to become the ultimate form of government; and may be anticipated without
dread by considering that the <cite>collective</cite> voice of a people is as likely to be
sound in state administration as in criticisms on art,’ pp. 57-8. In the first
place, the expressions of opinion which are brought together in Mr. Wallace’s
summary are separated in the original text by a considerable interval—an important
circumstance when we are dealing with so inconsistent a writer; then
what Aristotle says about the collective wisdom of the people, besides being advanced
with extreme hesitation, is not a reassurance against any danger to be
dreaded from their supremacy, but an answer to the argument that the few had a
natural right to political power from their greater wealth and better education;
the whole question being, in this connexion, one of political justice, not of political
expediency; finally, not only is ‘ultimate form of government’ a very strong
rendering of the Greek words, but what Aristotle says on the subject in his third
book is virtually retracted in the fifth, where oligarchy, democracy, and tyranny
are regarded as succeeding each other in any order indifferently, and Plato (or the
Platonic Socrates) is censured for assuming a constant sequence of revolutions.
The explanation of this change seems to be that when Aristotle wrote his third
book he was only acquainted with the history of Athens and a few other of the
greater states, but that subsequently a vast collection of facts bearing on the subject
came to his knowledge, showing that each form of government embraced more
varieties and admitted of more mutations than he had been originally aware of;
and this led to a complete recast of his opinions.</p></div>

Many of the topics noted are not only trite enough, but have no possible
bearing on the subject under which they stand. For instance, in discussing
judicial eloquence Aristotle goes into the motives for committing crime; among
these are pleasurable feelings of every kind, including the remembrance of past
trouble. Even the hero of a spasmodic tragedy would hardly have committed an
offence for the purpose of procuring himself this form of experience.</p></div>

As an illustration of the stimulating effect produced by the study of Aristotle’s
logic, we quote the following anecdote from the notes to Whately’s edition of
Bacon’s <cite>Essays</cite>:—‘The late Sir Alexander Johnstone, when acting as temporary
Governor of Ceylon (soon after its cession), sat once as judge in a trial of a prisoner
for a robbery and murder; and the evidence seemed to him so conclusive, that he
was about to charge the jury (who were native Cingalese) to find a verdict of
guilty. But one of the jurors asked and obtained permission to examine the
witnesses himself. He had them brought in one by one, and cross-examined
them so ably as to elicit the fact that they were <cite>themselves</cite> the perpetrators of the
crime, which they afterwards had conspired to impute to the prisoner. And they
were accordingly put on their trial and convicted. Sir Alexander Johnstone was
greatly struck by the intelligence displayed by this juror, the more so as he was
only a small farmer, who was not known to have had any remarkable advantages
of education. He sent for him, and after commending the wonderful sagacity he
had shown, inquired eagerly what his studies had been. The man replied that
he had never read but one book, the only one he possessed, which had long been
in his family, and which he delighted to study in his leisure hours. This book he
was prevailed on to show to Sir Alexander Johnstone, who put it into the hands
of one who knew the Cingalese language. It turned out to be a translation into
that language of a large portion of Aristotle’s <cite>Organon</cite>. It appears that the
Portuguese, when they first settled in Ceylon and other parts of the East, translated
into the native languages several of the works then studied in the European
Universities, among which were the Latin versions of Aristotle. The Cingalese
in question said that if his understanding had been in any degree cultivated and
improved, it was to that book that he owed it. It is likely, however (as was observed
to me [Whately] by the late Bishop Copleston), that any other book, containing
an equal amount of close reasoning and accurate definition, might have answered
the same purpose in sharpening the intellect of the Cingalese.’ Possibly, but not
to the same effect. What the Cingalese got into his hands was a triple-distilled
essence of Athenian legal procedure. The cross-examining elenchus was first
borrowed by Socrates from the Athenian courts and applied to philosophical
purposes; it was still further elaborated by Plato, and finally reduced to abstract
rules by Aristotle; so that in using it as he did the juror was only restoring it to
its original purposes.</p></div>

It is perfectly possible that Aristotle was not acquainted at first hand with
human anatomy. But Sir A. Grant is hardly justified in observing that the words
quoted above ‘do not show the hardihood of the practised dissecter’ (<cite>Aristotle</cite>,
p 3). Aristotle simply takes the popular point of view in order to prove that
the internal structure of the lower animals is no more offensive to the eye than
that of man. And, as he took so much delight in the former, nothing but want
of opportunity is likely to have prevented him from extending his researches to
the latter.</p></div>

The hypothesis of the earth’s diurnal rotation had clearly been suggested by
a celebrated passage in Plato’s <cite>Timaeus</cite>, though whether Plato himself held it is
still doubtful. That he accepted the revolution of the celestial spheres is absolutely
certain; but while to our minds the two beliefs are mutually exclusive, Grote
thinks that Plato overlooked the inconsistency. It seems probable that the one
was at first actually a generalisation from the other; it was thought that the earth
must revolve <cite>because</cite> the crystal spheres revolved; then the new doctrine, thus
accidentally struck out, was used to destroy the old one.</p></div>

This may seem inconsistent with our former assertion, that Hegel holds in
German philosophy a place analogous to that held by Aristotle in Greek philosophy.
Such analogies, however, are always more or less incomplete; and, so
far as he attributes a self-moving power to ideas, Hegel is a Platonist rather than
an Aristotelian. Similarly, as an evolutionist, Mr. Herbert Spencer stands
much nearer to early Greek thought than to Aristotle, whom, in other respects, he
so much resembles.</p></div>

These are τί, ποιόν, ποσόν, ποῦ, ποτέ, and πῶς. Τί is associated with πρός
in the question πρὸς τί, which has no simple English equivalent. Apparently it
was suggested to Aristotle by ποσόν, how much? in connexion with which it
means, in relation to what standard? If we were told that a thing was double,
we should ask, double what? Again, the Greeks had a simply compound question,
τί παθών, meaning, what was the matter with him? or, what made him do
it? From this Aristotle extracted πάσχειν, a wider notion than our passion,
meaning whatever is done or happens to anything; which again would suggest
ποιεῖν, what it does. Finally, πῶς, taken alone, is too vague a question for any
answer, but must be taken in its simplest compounds πῶς διακείμενον and πῶς
ἔχον, which give the two rarely-occurring categories ἔχειν and κεῖσθαι, for which
it is on one occasion substituted (<cite>Soph. El.</cite>, xxii., p. 178, b, 39). Διὰ τί does not
figure among the categories, because it is reserved for the special analysis of οὐσία.</p></div>

The last chapter of the <cite>Posterior Analytics</cite> sets forth a much more developed

that it was composed at a considerably later date than the rest of the work, and
probably after the treatise on the Soul, to which we should almost suspect an
allusion in the word πάλαι (p. 100, a, 14), did philology permit. The reference

‘Die Wissenschaft soll die Erscheinungen aus ihren Gründen erklären,
welche näher in den allgemeinen Ursachen und Gesetzen zu suchen sind’
(Zeller, p. 203). ‘Induction is the method of proceeding from particular
instances to general laws’ (Wallace, p. 13). ‘It seems to have been his
[Aristotle’s] idea that after gathering facts up to a certain point, a flash of
intuition would supervene, telling us “This is a law”’ (Grant, p. 68). <cite>Apropos</cite>
of the discussion whence this last passage is extracted, we may observe that Sir
A. Grant is quite mistaken in saying that Aristotle ‘omits to provide for verification.’
Aristotle is, on the contrary, most anxious to show that his theories agree
with all the known facts. See in particular his memorable declaration (<cite>De Gen.
An.</cite>, III., x., p. 760, b, 27), that facts are more to be trusted than reasonings.
</p>
<p>
The emphasis laid by Aristotle on concepts as distinguished from laws is
noticed by J. H. v. Kirchmann, in his German translation of the <cite>Metaphysics</cite>,
p. 13.</p></div>

As if Mill wrote exclusively for Oxford tutors, and as if other philosophers
had not constantly elucidated their arguments by concrete examples. One does
not see why the village matron should be more deserving of contempt than
Aristotle’s Thebans and Phocians.</p></div>

It may possibly be urged that the fifth book of the <cite>Nicomachean Ethics</cite> is of
doubtful authenticity. Still the dilemma remains that Aristotle either omitted the
most important of all moral questions from his ethics, or that he treated it in a
miserably inadequate manner.</p></div>
